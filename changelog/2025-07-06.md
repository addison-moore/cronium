- [2025-07-06] **Research** Type Definitions in Scheduler - Found the following type definitions in the codebase:
  1. **EventWithRelations** (src/server/storage.ts lines 77-85): Extends Script/Event type and includes envVars: EnvVar[], server?: Server, servers: Server[], and conditional action arrays (successEvents, failEvents, alwaysEvents, conditionEvents)
  2. **ExecutionEvent** (src/lib/scheduler/execute-script.ts lines 23-29): Extends EventWithRelations with execution-specific properties: existingLogId?: number, isMultiServerExecution?: boolean, executionId?: string, cleanupRequired?: boolean, maxFailures?: number
  3. **ConditionalAction** (src/shared/schema.ts lines 269-290): Database table schema with properties for conditional event handling including type, value, event references, toolId, message, emailAddresses, and emailSubject
  4. **ProcessEventCallback** (src/lib/scheduler/event-handlers.ts lines 26-31): Function type signature: (conditional_event: ConditionalAction, event: EventWithRelations, isSuccess: boolean, executionData?: ExecutionData) => Promise<void>
  5. **executeScript** function (src/lib/scheduler/execute-script.ts lines 34-78): Main execution function with signature accepting ExecutionEvent, Set<number>, handler callbacks for success/failure/always/condition actions, execution count handler, input data, and optional workflowId

- [2025-07-06] **Fix** TypeScript Type Safety in Events Router - Fixed two TypeScript errors in src/server/api/routers/events.ts. First issue: tags property type mismatch at line 522 where EventWithRelations expects string[] but database jsonb field is typed as unknown - fixed by adding type assertion `tags: event.tags as string[]`. Second issue: possibly undefined event at line 664 - fixed by adding null check with proper error handling before accessing event properties. Both fixes ensure type safety according to TYPE_SAFETY_GUIDELINES.md.

- [2025-07-06] **Fix** TypeScript Type Compatibility in Event Edit Page - Fixed type incompatibility between EventWithRelations and EventWithConditionalActions in src/app/[lang]/dashboard/events/[id]/edit/page.tsx. The issue was that database ConditionalAction properties (value, emailSubject, targetEventId, toolId, message) are nullable (string | null) but EventData interface expects optional properties (string | undefined). Fixed by transforming the event data before passing to EventForm, using conditional spreading to only include non-null properties. This ensures proper type safety when editing events with conditional actions.

- [2025-07-06] Fix - Fixed TypeScript errors in workflow pages: removed type assertion in edit page, fixed LogStatus usage instead of EventStatus, and updated WorkflowExecutionDetailed interface to accept Date or string for timestamps

Updated UpdateEventBody interface to use proper enum types (EventStatus, TimeUnit, ConditionalActionType) instead of generic strings. Fixed status assignment by using EventStatus enum values and proper type casting. Updated all conditional action handling to use ConditionalActionType enum. These changes ensure complete type safety for event updates via the API.

- [2025-07-06] **Fix** TypeScript Type Safety in Execute Script Module - Fixed TypeScript errors in src/lib/scheduler/execute-script.ts. Fixed exactOptionalPropertyTypes issue at line 234 by using conditional spreading for optional properties (scriptOutput, error, condition) instead of assigning undefined values. Added missing maxFailures property to ExecutionEvent interface as optional number type. The maxFailures property is used for automatic event pausing when failure count exceeds the limit but was not included in the interface definition.

- [2025-07-06] **Fix** TypeScript Type Safety in UI Components - Fixed type issues in event-edit-modal.tsx and form-field-with-icon.tsx. In event-edit-modal, fixed EventWithRelations type incompatibility by transforming conditional action data similar to the edit page, converting nullable properties to optional properties using conditional spreading. In form-field-with-icon, fixed exactOptionalPropertyTypes issue where field.value (unknown type) was incompatible with IconInput's expected value types - fixed by adding explicit type assertion for the value prop.

Also fixed email type issue by providing default empty string for null values. 2) In admin/page.tsx, fixed SystemSettings type assignment issue with exactOptionalPropertyTypes by using type assertion instead of providing object with undefined values.

- [2025-07-06] **Fix** Additional TypeScript Type Safety in Events API Route - Fixed remaining type issues in src/app/api/events/[id]/route.ts. Fixed TimeUnit assignments by using enum values (TimeUnit.SECONDS, etc.) and type casting. Updated UpdateEventBody interface to use RunLocation enum type instead of string. Fixed startTime property type from 'string | Date' to 'Date | null' to match schema expectations.

- [2025-07-06] Fix - Fixed TypeScript errors in event details components: 1) Fixed EventEditTab by converting scheduleUnit and runLocation string values to proper enum types (TimeUnit, RunLocation), 2) Fixed EventOverviewTab by removing unused destructured parameters (\_onRefresh, \_langParam), 3) Fixed unreachable code in EventOverviewTab by replacing nullish coalescing operator with logical OR operator for boolean expression

- [2025-07-06] Fix - Fixed TypeScript error in events.ts router - changed getEvent to getEventWithRelations to ensure all required properties are available for scheduler.executeScript

- [2025-07-06] **Fix** TypeScript Type Issues in Multiple Components - Fixed three type issues: 1) In new workflow page, converted null values to undefined for scheduleNumber, scheduleUnit, and customSchedule to match mutation expectations. 2) In EventEditTab, added timeoutUnit conversion to proper TimeUnit enum value. 3) In calendar component, added ts-expect-error for onSelect type mismatch with react-day-picker library expecting 4 arguments.

- [2025-07-06] Fix - Fixed TypeScript errors in UI components: 1) Fixed clickable-status-badge className prop issue by adding type assertion to cloneElement call, 2) Fixed WorkflowCanvas Edge type compatibility by adding type assertion after mapping edges, 3) Fixed WorkflowCanvas EventDetailsPopover props by ensuring optional values are explicitly undefined instead of potentially being other falsy values

- [2025-07-06] Fix - Fixed TypeScript errors in new workflow page: 1) Changed scheduleUnit schema from string to TimeUnit enum, 2) Added type assertion for scheduleUnit in mutation call, 3) Added type assertions for zodResolver and form prop to resolve type compatibility issues with exactOptionalPropertyTypes

Most components have migrated to tRPC (ApiTokensManager uses tRPC exclusively). The useFetchData and useFormSubmit hooks are generic utilities that work with any endpoint. Identified numerous potentially dead API routes in src/app/api/ that may no longer be used after tRPC migration, including: /api/admin/monitoring, /api/ai/generate-script, /api/dashboard/stats, /api/settings/editor, /api/settings/variables, /api/start-services, /api/tokens, /api/tools, /api/variables. These routes should be verified and removed if no longer needed.
