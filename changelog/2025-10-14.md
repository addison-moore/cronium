## Monitoring and Infrastructure Changes

- [2025-10-14] [Refactor] Removed external Grafana and Prometheus monitoring support
  - Removed Grafana and Prometheus services from Docker Compose files (docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.dev.yml)
  - Removed environment variables PROMETHEUS_URL and GRAFANA_URL from documentation and configuration
  - Deleted monitoring directory containing Grafana/Prometheus configuration files
  - Updated ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md to remove external monitoring section
  - Updated DEPLOYMENT.md to focus on health check endpoints instead of external monitoring
  - Removed Grafana and Prometheus entries from service-discovery.json
  - Updated setup-env.sh script to remove monitoring environment variables
  - Kept internal Prometheus metrics collection in orchestrator for internal use
  - Note: Internal metrics endpoints (/metrics) remain available for future monitoring integration

## Rationale

Removed external Grafana and Prometheus monitoring to simplify the deployment and reduce infrastructure overhead. The application retains internal metrics collection capability using Prometheus client libraries, which can be integrated with external monitoring solutions if needed in the future.
