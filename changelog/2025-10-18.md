- [2025-10-18] [Bug Fix] Fixed ToolActionExecutionContext interface in server-action-executor.ts - added missing value parameter to variables.set function
- [2025-10-18] [Bug Fix] Fixed ServerActionDefinition optional features property handling with exactOptionalPropertyTypes
- [2025-10-18] [Bug Fix] Implemented global singleton pattern for ToolPluginRegistry to persist across Next.js serverless invocations

- [2025-10-18] [Action Required] Next.js server must be restarted for instrumentation changes to take effect
- [2025-10-18] [CRITICAL Bug Fix] Fixed timeout unit conversion bug in job-transformer.ts - timeout units (MINUTES, HOURS, DAYS) were not being converted to seconds, causing premature timeouts
- [2025-10-18] [Feature] Added convertTimeoutToSeconds helper function to properly handle timeout unit conversion
- [2025-10-18] [Testing] Created test-timeout-conversion.ts script to verify all timeout units convert correctly
- [2025-10-18] [Feature] Added system-wide timeout configuration with separate timeouts for setup, execution, and cleanup phases
- [2025-10-18] [Feature] Added TimeoutConfig to orchestrator with environment variable support (CRONIUM_SETUP_TIMEOUT, CRONIUM_CLEANUP_TIMEOUT, CRONIUM_MAX_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT)
- [2025-10-18] [Refactor] Updated container and SSH executors to use TimeoutConfig for phase-based timeout management
- [2025-10-18] [Documentation] Updated .env.example with timeout configuration settings and explanations
- [2025-10-18] [Implementation] Created phase_executor.go files for both container and SSH executors to handle phase-based timeouts
- [2025-10-18] [Implementation] Refactored Execute methods to use executeWithPhaseTimeouts for proper timeout separation
- [2025-10-18] [Bug Fix] Fixed SSH executor compilation errors by using correct method signatures (createPayloadForJob, ensureRunnerDeployed, copyPayloadToServer)
- [2025-10-18] [Testing] Created test-timeout-integration.ts to verify timeout unit conversion and placement
- [2025-10-18] [Testing] Created test-phase-timeouts.ts for comprehensive timeout scenario testing
- [2025-10-18] [Testing] Verified orchestrator properly loads timeout configuration from environment variables
- [2025-10-18] [Testing] All integration tests pass - phase-based timeouts working correctly
- [2025-10-18] [Documentation] Created comprehensive TIMEOUTS.md documentation explaining phase-based timeout system
- [2025-10-18] [Documentation] Updated ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md with timeout configuration settings
- [2025-10-18] [COMPLETE] Phase-based timeout implementation fully deployed - user timeouts now only apply to script execution, not infrastructure setup
