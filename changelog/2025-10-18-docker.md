# Docker Deployment Configuration

- [2025-10-18] [Feature] Created production-ready multi-stage Dockerfile for cronium-app with security best practices
- [2025-10-18] [Feature] Updated orchestrator Dockerfile to use distroless base image for minimal attack surface
- [2025-10-18] [Security] Created comprehensive .dockerignore files to exclude sensitive data from images
- [2025-10-18] [Feature] Created GitHub Actions workflow for automated building and publishing to ghcr.io
- [2025-10-18] [Feature] Added image signing with cosign and vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- [2025-10-18] [Documentation] Created docker-compose.example.yml for easy self-hosted deployment
- [2025-10-18] [Documentation] Created .env.example with all required environment variables
- [2025-10-18] [Documentation] Added comprehensive Docker deployment guide (DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md)

## Security Improvements

- All containers run as non-root users
- No secrets or environment variables included in images
- Multi-stage builds minimize final image size and attack surface
- Orchestrator uses distroless base image (no shell, minimal packages)
- Images are signed with cosign for verification
- Automated vulnerability scanning on every build
- Comprehensive .dockerignore files prevent sensitive data leakage

## Deployment Simplification

Users can now deploy Cronium without cloning the repository:

1. Download docker-compose.example.yml and .env.example
2. Generate secure secrets
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. Access at http://localhost:3000

## Image Publishing

Images will be published to GitHub Container Registry:

- `ghcr.io/yourusername/cronium-app:latest`
- `ghcr.io/yourusername/cronium-orchestrator:latest`

Both images support linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 platforms.
