## Bug Fixes

### Fixed Execution ID Mismatch in SSH Runner

- **Issue**: Helper binaries were using execution ID from manifest instead of the one from orchestrator, causing JWT validation failures
- **Root Cause**: Execution ID was being generated twice - once when creating the payload (with milliseconds) and once by the orchestrator (with seconds)
- **Fix**: Modified runner to prioritize execution ID from environment variable (set by orchestrator) over the one in the manifest
- **Files Changed**:
  - `apps/runner/cronium-runner/internal/executor/executor.go` - Fixed environment variable priority
  - `apps/runner/cronium-runner/internal/executor/helpers.go` - Updated helper configuration to use orchestrator's execution ID

### Improved SSH Runner Deployment in Development

- **Issue**: Cached runners on remote servers were not being updated during development
- **Fix**: Modified orchestrator to always redeploy runners when version is "dev"
- **Files Changed**:
  - `apps/orchestrator/internal/executors/ssh/executor.go` - Added cache bypass for dev mode

## Improvements

### Optimized Runner Binary Size

- **Change**: Simplified helper binary embedding to only include Linux binaries (not macOS/Windows)
- **Result**: Reduced runner binary size from 120MB to ~61MB
- **Files Changed**:
  - `apps/runner/cronium-runner/internal/helpers/embed.go` - Simplified embedding approach
  - `apps/runner/cronium-runner/build-helpers-simple.sh` - Streamlined build script

## Cleanup

- Removed debug logging code added during troubleshooting
- Removed obsolete build scripts and test files
- Cleaned up runner artifact directories
