# Changelog - 2025-07-14

## Phase 4.1 Container Management - Completed

### Container Creation & Management

- [2025-07-14] [Analysis] Verified Docker image selection logic with default images and environment variable overrides
- [2025-07-14] [Analysis] Confirmed container configuration with proper security settings (non-root, dropped capabilities, resource limits)
- [2025-07-14] [Analysis] Validated network isolation with per-job Docker networks and internal-only access
- [2025-07-14] [Analysis] Verified volume management using tmpfs mounts only (no persistent volumes for security)

### Key Findings

- **Runtime Helper Integration**: Scripts are baked into Docker images during build, not mounted at runtime
- **Network Architecture**: Clever dual-network design allows sidecar to bridge between isolated job network and backend services
- **Security Model**: Complete filesystem isolation, non-root execution, resource limits, and JWT-based authentication
- **Container Lifecycle**: Proper creation flow with health checks and cleanup on completion

### Documentation

## Remaining Linting Issues

The following TypeScript type safety warnings remain and should be addressed in a separate task:

- These are all related to the `error` type in catch blocks and require more careful type narrowing
