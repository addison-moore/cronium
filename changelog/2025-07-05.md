The component was not loading existing conditional actions (successEvents, failEvents, alwaysEvents, conditionEvents) from eventData when editing an event. Added initialization logic in the useEffect hook to properly map these arrays from the EventWithRelations type to ConditionalActionFormData format. Each action type is properly mapped with its corresponding trigger type (ON_SUCCESS, ON_FAILURE, ALWAYS, ON_CONDITION) and all relevant properties (targetEventId, toolId, message, emailAddresses, emailSubject) are preserved. This ensures that conditional actions are correctly displayed when editing existing events.

- [2025-07-05] **Fix** TypeScript Type Safety in EventForm Component - Fixed unsafe assignment of `any` value at line 1231 in src/components/event-form/EventForm.tsx according to TYPE_SAFETY_GUIDELINES.md. The error occurred when passing eventData (of type Partial<Event>) to ConditionalActionsSection which expects EventData type with specific conditional action properties. Fixed by: 1) Exporting EventData interface from ConditionalActionsSection, 2) Creating EventWithConditionalActions type that extends Partial<Event> & ConditionalActionsEventData to properly type the event data with conditional actions, 3) Updating EventFormProps interface to use the new type for initialScript and initialData props, 4) Explicitly mapping only the EventData properties (successEvents, failEvents, alwaysEvents, conditionEvents) when passing to ConditionalActionsSection. This eliminates all type incompatibility errors while maintaining full type safety.

- [2025-07-05] **Fix** TypeScript Type Safety in tRPC Context - Fixed type conversion error in src/server/api/trpc.ts at line 70 according to TYPE_SAFETY_GUIDELINES.md. The error occurred when creating a mock response object for getServerSession fallback. Fixed by converting to `unknown` first before casting to the expected type, as suggested by TypeScript error message. This follows the guideline of avoiding dangerous type assertions without proper intermediate conversions.

- [2025-07-05] [Feature] Created comprehensive tRPC migration plan (\_plans/tRPC_Migration.md) outlining 5-phase approach to complete REST to tRPC transition

- [2025-07-05] [Feature] Completed Phase 1 of tRPC migration - Created tRPC versions of critical infrastructure hooks (usePermissions-trpc.ts and useAuth-trpc.ts), updated all components using these hooks to use the new tRPC versions, and created tRPC versions of auth pages (forgot-password and reset-password). Note: signin and activate pages kept as REST endpoints since they are tightly integrated with NextAuth authentication flow.

- [2025-07-05] [Fix] Fixed TypeScript errors in auth pages (forgot-password and reset-password) - Changed incorrect tRPC import from '@/trpc/react' to '@/lib/trpc' in both pages. The tRPC library automatically provides proper type inference for mutation callbacks, eliminating implicit 'any' type errors according to TYPE_SAFETY_GUIDELINES.md.

- [2025-07-05] [Feature] Completed Phase 2 of tRPC migration - Verified that all core feature components (Events and Workflows) are already migrated to tRPC. Components checked and confirmed: ConditionalActionsSection.tsx, EventDetailsTab.tsx, EventEditTab.tsx, EditorSettingsModal.tsx, ResetCounterSwitch.tsx, WorkflowDetailsForm.tsx, WorkflowForm.tsx, and WorkflowsCard.tsx. All components are using tRPC imports from '@/lib/trpc' and appropriate tRPC queries/mutations with proper type safety according to TYPE_SAFETY_GUIDELINES.md.
