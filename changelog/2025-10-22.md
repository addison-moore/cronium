## Key Fixes

### Package Dependencies

- Added `@tailwindcss/postcss` and `tailwindcss` v4 to packages/ui devDependencies
- Resolved PostCSS module resolution errors in Docker builds

### TypeScript Type Inference

- Added explicit type aliases for all forwardRef components in command.tsx
- Exported type definitions to prevent "cannot be named without reference" errors
- Ensures consistent type inference across different build environments (local vs Docker)

These fixes resolve the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline failures that were preventing successful Docker image builds for deployment.
