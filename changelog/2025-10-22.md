# Docker Deployment Configuration Updates

- [2025-10-22] [Bug Fix] Added missing Tailwind CSS v4 dependencies (@tailwindcss/postcss and tailwindcss) to packages/ui for Docker builds
- [2025-10-22] [Bug Fix] Fixed TypeScript type inference errors in packages/ui command.tsx with explicit type annotations to resolve monorepo build issues in Docker
- [2025-10-22] [Bug Fix] Added type exports for all command components to improve type portability across the monorepo

## Key Fixes

### Package Dependencies

- Added `@tailwindcss/postcss` and `tailwindcss` v4 to packages/ui devDependencies
- Resolved PostCSS module resolution errors in Docker builds

### TypeScript Type Inference

- Added explicit type aliases for all forwardRef components in command.tsx
- Exported type definitions to prevent "cannot be named without reference" errors
- Ensures consistent type inference across different build environments (local vs Docker)

These fixes resolve the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline failures that were preventing successful Docker image builds for deployment.
