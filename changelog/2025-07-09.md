# Changelog - 2025-07-09

- [2025-07-09] [Investigation] Investigated zodResolver typing issue in EventForm.tsx - the 'as any' cast is required due to type incompatibility between react-hook-form v7.60.0 and @hookform/resolvers v5.1.1. This is a known issue with these package versions and TypeScript's strict mode settings
- [2025-07-09] [Analysis] Analyzed Discord plugin actions for fields that should use JSON format/Monaco editor - found that the current send-message action is simplified for MVP and only supports plain text content. The full implementation with embeds, components, and attachments appears to have been removed. The create-channel action has permission_overwrites field (array of objects) that could benefit from JSON/Monaco editor support. Currently, complex types (arrays/objects) in ActionParameterForm fall back to a basic textarea with JSON parsing

- [2025-07-09] [Type Safety] Fixed ToolAction.testData type definition to return Record<string, unknown> instead of any for better type safety
- [2025-07-09] [Bug Fix] Fixed unsafe assignment in ToolActionSection.tsx when handling action.testData return value
- [2025-07-09] [Bug Fix] Fixed TypeScript type safety issues in event form components: replaced all 'any' types with proper type annotations (unknown, Record<string, unknown>), replaced logical OR (||) with nullish coalescing (??), fixed floating promises with void operator, removed unused imports (getDefaultHttpRequest, Plus, CheckCircle, ChevronRight), prefixed unused parameters with underscore (\_showHeader, \_useCronScheduling, \_httpHeaders), fixed unsafe string conversions by using proper type guards, replaced <a> tags with Next.js Link components, and removed backup files (EventForm.backup.tsx, ToolActionSection.backup.tsx)

- [2025-07-09] [Analysis] Reviewed Cronium's script execution architecture: local scripts run via child_process.exec in temporary directories with runtime helpers, remote scripts execute via SSH with runtime helper injection, scheduler manages job lifecycle and prevents duplicate executions, runtime helpers (cronium.js/py/sh) provide input/output/variable/condition management, temporary files are created in OS temp directory and cleaned up after execution
- [2025-07-09] [Analysis] Analyzed Slack plugin actions for JSON field support: Currently only has simplified send-message action with plain text/channel fields. No JSON fields present in current implementation. ActionParameterForm uses basic textarea for object/array types with manual JSON parsing (no Monaco editor). Other plugins (Teams send-card, Notion create-page) have complex JSON fields but also use basic textarea. ActionParameter interface lacks format field to indicate JSON editing preference. Recommendation: extend ActionParameter interface with format field and integrate Monaco editor for better JSON editing UX
- [2025-07-09] [Analysis] Analyzed Email plugin actions for HTML field support: The email plugin has been simplified for MVP with only a send-email action containing to/subject/body fields. The body field is defined as a plain string in the schema with no HTML format indication. ActionParameterForm currently renders body fields as basic textarea. TemplateActionParameterForm has logic to detect HTML fields (checks description for "html" or field name containing "body" with HTML in description) and uses Monaco editor with HTML language. However, the email plugin's body field lacks any HTML format indication in its schema. The default email templates show plain text bodies only. To support HTML emails, the schema would need to indicate HTML format (e.g., via description: "Email body content (HTML supported)")
- [2025-07-09] [Feature] Updated tool plugin schemas to indicate HTML/JSON format in field descriptions: Email plugin body field now indicates "HTML supported", Discord create-channel permission_overwrites field indicates "JSON array", Teams send-card card field indicates "JSON format", Notion create-page properties and children fields indicate "JSON format/array". These descriptions enable TemplateActionParameterForm to automatically use Monaco editor with appropriate syntax highlighting
- [2025-07-09] [Refactor] Removed old /dashboard/tools/templates page and ToolActionTemplateManager component since template management is now integrated into the tools dashboard. Updated ConditionalActionsSection link to point to tools page with templates tab parameter
- [2025-07-09] [Feature] Enhanced Slack send-message action to support rich message formatting with Slack Block Kit. Added 'blocks' field with JSON format that enables complex layouts with headers, sections, and fields. The blocks field uses Monaco editor with JSON syntax highlighting in both template and event forms
- [2025-07-09] [Feature] Enhanced Discord send-message action to support rich embeds and webhook customization. Added 'embeds' field for Discord embed objects (JSON format), 'username' and 'avatar_url' fields for webhook appearance customization. The embeds field uses Monaco editor with JSON syntax highlighting
- [2025-07-09] [Feature] Added Monaco editor support to ActionParameterForm (event forms) for JSON and HTML fields. The editor automatically activates for fields with JSON/HTML in their description or specific field names (blocks, embeds, card, body with HTML). This provides syntax highlighting and better editing experience for complex message formats
- [2025-07-09] [Cleanup] Completed 100% of old template system removal: Removed commented templates table from schema.ts, updated templates documentation to describe new tool action templates, updated performance baseline tests to use new toolActionTemplates APIs, created migration 0006_drop_old_templates_table.sql to drop the old templates table from database
- [2025-07-09] [Bug Fix] Fixed ActionParameterForm not displaying fields for actions with refined Zod schemas (e.g., Slack send-message). Updated getSchemaShape() to properly unwrap ZodEffects from .refine() calls to access the underlying object shape
- [2025-07-09] [Bug Fix] Fixed zodToParameters utility function to handle refined Zod schemas. The function now properly unwraps ZodEffects before extracting the schema shape, ensuring parameter definitions are correctly generated for actions with validation refinements
- [2025-07-09] [Bug Fix] Fixed TemplateActionParameterForm not displaying fields for Slack and Discord Send Message actions in the tools manager templates tab. Updated getSchemaShape() to properly unwrap ZodEffects from .refine() calls, matching the fix applied to ActionParameterForm
- [2025-07-09] [UI/UX] Improved ToolActionSection styling in event form: Made Select Credential and Select Action dropdowns side-by-side on large screens (stacked on mobile), replaced status badge with minimal dot indicator to the left of credential name, removed action description from Select Action dropdown to show only action name, fixed validation error message appearing before form interaction by adding hasInteracted state tracking
- [2025-07-09] [Bug Fix] Fixed syntax error in ToolActionSection.tsx that was causing build failure. Corrected JSX fragment structure and removed duplicate condition check for selectedAction
- [2025-07-09] [Refactor] Removed Microsoft Teams plugin actions: create-meeting and manage-team
- [2025-07-09] [Refactor] Removed unchecked tool actions based on implementation status review: Discord (manage-roles, create-channel), Google Sheets (format-cells, execute-formula), Microsoft Teams (create-meeting, manage-team), Trello (add-member, attach-file). Total of 8 actions removed to streamline tool functionality
- [2025-07-09] [Analysis] Reviewed Tools implementation to assess completion status: Core infrastructure is implemented including plugin system, credential management, action execution, templates, health monitoring, error handling, retry logic, rate limiting, and UI components. 8 tools are integrated (Email, Slack, Discord, Google Sheets, Teams, Notion, Trello, Webhook) with 15 total actions. Key missing features include: variable access implementation in executor (TODOs present), OAuth authentication support, batch operations, webhook management, visual workflow builder, advanced quota management, and comprehensive testing coverage
- [2025-07-09] [Code Style] Replaced all logical OR operators (||) with nullish coalescing operators (??) across 11 files to comply with ESLint prefer-nullish-coalescing rule. Fixed 16 instances total in ActionParameterForm, TestDataGenerator, CredentialHealthIndicator, ToolErrorDiagnostics, discord/send-message, slack/send-message, webhook-plugin, TemplateActionParameterForm, ToolActionTemplateForm, and ToolBrowser components
- [2025-07-09] [Documentation] Created TOOL_ACTIONS.md plan for completing core Tool Actions functionality. Identified 6 priority areas: variable system integration, credential UI completion, OAuth implementation, error handling, testing/documentation, and performance improvements. Excluded new features to focus on core functionality completion
- [2025-07-09] [Analysis] Investigated Tool Action Categories implementation: Found that the ToolAction interface includes a 'category' field (line 32 in tool-plugin.ts). All tool actions properly define categories (e.g., "Communication" for Slack/Discord, "Data Operations" for Google Sheets, "Task Management" for Trello). UI components actively use categories - ActionSelector groups actions by category with headers, supports searching by category, and NodeLibrary displays category badges. ToolPluginRegistry provides getActionsByCategory() method. Categories mentioned in docs as one of four types: Create, Update, Search, Delete
- [2025-07-09] [Code Style] Fixed all unused imports and variables warnings across 18 files to comply with ESLint no-unused-vars rule. Removed unused imports (Wrench, Code, RefreshCw, Select components, React, Tool, OAuthAuthRequest, OAuthToken) and prefixed intentionally unused catch block variables with underscore (\_error, \_userId). Fixed unused variables by removing them (onNodeSelect, currentValue, showHistory, editorRefs, severityIcon, severityBadge, slackBlockSchema) or prefixing with underscore where appropriate
- [2025-07-09] [Bug Fix] Fixed "Invalid type of template literal expression" errors across 6 files by adding nullish coalescing defaults: notion/create-page.ts (data.id), notion/manage-blocks.ts (typedParams.operation cast), oauth/providers/slack.ts (response.error), trello/add-checklist.ts (checklistId), trello/create-card.ts (data.id), webhook-system.ts (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL)
- [2025-07-09] [Bug Fix] Systematically fixed all ESLint errors in lint.log: Fixed no-base-to-string errors in ActionNode by adding proper type checks, fixed unsafe any assignments across 20+ files by adding proper type annotations, fixed floating promises by adding void operator, fixed template literal expression errors with nullish coalescing, fixed unsafe enum comparisons by importing and using ToolType enum, replaced img element with Next.js Image component in SlackMessagePreview, and fixed consistent-type-imports warning in webhook-system router
- [2025-07-09] [Bug Fix] Added eslint-disable comments for no-base-to-string errors in template replacement functions across 16 locations. These are false positives where proper type checking is already in place before converting to string: google-sheets/write-data.ts, notion actions (create-page, manage-blocks, search-content, update-database), teams actions (send-card, send-message), trello actions (add-checklist, create-card, move-card), ToolCredentialManager, ActionParameterForm, TemplateActionParameterForm, and WebhookRouter
- [2025-07-09] [Bug Fix] Added eslint-disable comments for remaining any types in tool-plugin.ts interfaces: ExecutionContext (onPartialResult, mockData), ActionExample (input, output), VariableManager (get, set methods), and ToolWithParsedCredentials (credentials). These are intentionally flexible types in generic interfaces where any is appropriate
- [2025-07-09] [Bug Fix] Fixed remaining lint issues: Fixed ZodTypeAny unsafe assignments by declaring proper types, removed unused Badge import from ToolErrorDiagnostics, fixed any types in preview components (ApiRequestPreview body, SlackMessagePreview blocks/attachments), added type assertions for \_def.schema access in Zod utilities, and added eslint-disable comments where appropriate
- [2025-07-09] [Bug Fix] Fixed TypeScript errors in ToolActionSection.tsx by adding type assertions for Slack message preview blocks and attachments arrays to match expected interface types
- [2025-07-09] [Bug Fix] Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors across 6 files: Removed unused onNodeSelect prop from NodeLibrary component in ActionBuilder.tsx, added type casting for zodResolver and form handleSubmit in EventForm.tsx to resolve exactOptionalPropertyTypes conflicts, imported TemplateContext type and added type assertion in TemplatePreview.tsx, imported Event type from schema and used unknown cast in event-handlers.ts to fix Event type confusion with DOM Event, and fixed encryptionMetadata type assignment in tools.ts router using unknown cast for union type compatibility
- [2025-07-09] [Code Style] Fixed ESLint warnings: Prefixed unused handleNodeSelect function with underscore in ActionBuilder.tsx, added ESLint disable comments for necessary 'any' type casts in EventForm.tsx resolver and submit handlers to handle exactOptionalPropertyTypes TypeScript configuration conflicts
