## Application Analysis

- [2025-07-11] [Analysis] Conducted thorough review of Next.js application structure
- [2025-07-11] [Analysis] Identified all execution-related components requiring updates
- [2025-07-11] [Documentation] Created comprehensive App_Updates.md detailing required changes

## Key Findings

- [2025-07-11] [Security] Scripts run with full host system access - critical vulnerability

## Conditional Event Configuration Analysis

- [2025-07-11] [Documentation] Searched and analyzed event form components for conditional event configuration
- [2025-07-11] [Analysis] Found ConditionalActionsSection component that handles conditional event selection with options for:
  - ON_SUCCESS: Execute when parent event succeeds
  - ON_FAILURE: Execute when parent event fails
  - ALWAYS: Execute regardless of parent event outcome
  - ON_CONDITION: Execute based on custom conditions
- [2025-07-11] [Analysis] Identified two conditional action types:
  - SEND_MESSAGE: Send messages via tools (Email, Slack, Discord)
  - SCRIPT: Run another event (allows users to select target event from dropdown)
- [2025-07-11] [Analysis] Located database schema for conditional actions in shared/schema.ts with targetEventId field for linking events

## Self-Referencing Event Validation

- [2025-07-11] [Feature] Created event-validation.ts utility with circular dependency detection algorithm
- [2025-07-11] [Feature] Added getConditionalActionsByEventId method to storage.ts for retrieving conditional actions

- [2025-07-11] [Security] Prevents infinite loops by validating conditional actions before saving to database

## Current Execution Architecture Analysis

- [2025-07-11] [Analysis] Examined current execution implementation in Cronium Next.js application
- [2025-07-11] [Analysis] Found core execution logic in src/lib/scheduler/ directory:
  - scheduler.ts: Main scheduler class using node-schedule for cron jobs
  - execute-script.ts: Core execution logic with multi-server support
  - local-executor.ts: Local script execution using child_process.exec
  - http-executor.ts: HTTP request execution
  - tool-action-executor.ts: Tool action execution (Slack, Discord, etc)
- [2025-07-11] [Analysis] Key execution flow:
  1. Events are scheduled using node-schedule based on cron expressions
  2. When triggered, executeScript() determines execution type (local/remote/HTTP/tool)
  3. For local execution, scripts run via child_process.exec with runtime helpers
  4. Scripts execute in temporary directories with input/output/variables JSON files
  5. Runtime helpers (cronium.js/py/sh) are copied to execution directory
- [2025-07-11] [Analysis] WebSocket server implementation:
  - Separate Socket.IO server on port 5002 for terminal functionality
  - TerminalWebSocketHandler manages terminal sessions (local and SSH)
  - No real-time log streaming - logs are stored in database and polled
- [2025-07-11] [Analysis] API endpoints for execution:
  - tRPC router (events.execute) creates log entry and triggers async execution
  - No streaming of execution output - logs are written to database after completion
- [2025-07-11] [Analysis] Security concerns identified:
  - Scripts execute directly on host with full system access
  - No sandboxing or isolation for script execution
  - Environment variables and secrets accessible to all scripts
