## Old Template System Cleanup Audit

### Summary

Performed a comprehensive audit of the codebase to identify all references to the old template system that need to be cleaned up. The old template system has been migrated to the new tool action templates system, and many references remain that need to be removed or updated.

### Files Requiring Cleanup

#### 1. **Schema References**

- `/src/shared/schema.ts` - Line 575: `templates: many(templates)` in usersRelations (references non-existent templates table)
- Templates table definition is properly commented out (lines 431-447)

#### 2. **API Router References**

- `/src/server/api/routers/integrations.ts`:
  - Lines 111-146: `getUserTemplates` function (commented out)
  - Lines 582-774: Complete templates router section (commented out)
  - Line 7: Still imports template-related schemas from integrations

#### 3. **Component References**

- `/src/components/tools/modular-tools-manager.tsx` - Line 253: Uses `trpc.integrations.templates.create`
- `/src/components/tools/plugins/discord/discord-plugin.tsx` - References old templates
- `/src/components/tools/plugins/slack/slack-plugin.tsx` - References old templates
- `/src/components/tools/plugins/email/email-plugin.tsx` - References old templates

#### 4. **Event Form Components**

- `/src/components/event-form/ConditionalActionsSection.tsx` - May reference old templates
- `/src/components/event-form/ToolActionSection.tsx` - May reference old templates
- `/src/components/event-form/EventForm.tsx` - May reference old templates

#### 5. **Documentation Files**

- `/src/app/[lang]/docs/templates/page.tsx` - Entire page is about old template system

#### 6. **Schema Files**

- `/src/shared/schemas/integrations.ts` - Lines 146-203: Template-related schemas still defined

#### 7. **Other Files to Review**

- `/src/lib/template-seeding.ts` - Likely contains old template seeding logic
- `/src/lib/default-templates.ts` - Old default templates
- `/src/lib/template-processor.ts` - Old template processing logic
- `/src/components/tools/template-form.tsx` - Old template form component
- `/src/scripts/migrate-templates-to-tool-actions.ts` - Migration script (can be removed after cleanup)

### Recommendations

1. **Remove Commented Code**: Delete all commented-out template-related code in integrations.ts
2. **Update Schema Relations**: Fix the usersRelations to remove the templates reference
3. **Update Components**: Migrate all plugin components to use new tool action templates
4. **Remove Old Documentation**: Either update or remove the templates documentation page
5. **Clean Up Schemas**: Remove template schemas from integrations.ts
6. **Delete Old Files**: Remove old template-related files that are no longer needed
