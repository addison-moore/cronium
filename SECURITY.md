# Cronium Security Implementation

## Overview
Cronium now implements comprehensive encryption to protect sensitive data both in transit and at rest. This ensures that private keys, passwords, environment variables, and API tokens are always secured.

## Security Features

### üîí End-to-End Encryption
- **Client-side encryption** - Sensitive data is encrypted in the browser before transmission
- **Server-side encryption** - Additional encryption layer for data at rest
- **AES-256-GCM encryption** - Industry-standard encryption algorithm

### üîê Protected Data Types
- **SSH Private Keys** - Encrypted before storage in database
- **User Passwords** - Hashed using bcrypt with 12 rounds
- **Environment Variables** - Values encrypted to protect API keys and secrets
- **API Tokens** - All tokens encrypted in database
- **Settings** - Sensitive configuration values encrypted

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Layers

#### 1. Client-Side Protection
- Data encrypted in browser using Web Crypto API
- User-specific encryption keys stored in session storage
- PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations

#### 2. Server-Side Protection
- Master encryption key from environment variable
- Automatic encryption/decryption in storage layer
- Graceful fallback for legacy unencrypted data

#### 3. Database Security
- Sensitive fields automatically encrypted before storage
- Decryption only occurs when data is accessed
- Database contains only encrypted values

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Set the following environment variable for production:

```bash
# Generate a secure 64-character hex key
ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY=your_64_character_hex_key_here
```

### Generate Master Key
```bash
# Generate a secure master key
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

## Implementation Details

### Encrypted Fields by Table
- **servers**: `sshKey`
- **users**: `password` (hashed)
- **envVars**: `value`
- **apiTokens**: `token`
- **settings**: `value`

### Automatic Encryption
The system automatically:
1. Encrypts sensitive fields when creating/updating records
2. Decrypts sensitive fields when retrieving records
3. Maintains backward compatibility with existing data

## Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ What's Protected
- Private SSH keys are encrypted end-to-end
- Environment variables containing API keys are secured
- User passwords are properly hashed
- API tokens are encrypted in database
- Sensitive settings are protected

### üîß Development vs Production
- **Development**: Uses auto-generated temporary key (not secure)
- **Production**: Requires `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY` environment variable

### üö® Important Notes
1. **Backup encryption keys** - Loss of master key means data cannot be decrypted
2. **Use HTTPS** - Always use SSL/TLS in production
3. **Secure key storage** - Store master key securely (environment variables, vault, etc.)
4. **Regular key rotation** - Consider rotating encryption keys periodically

## Migration Strategy

### Existing Data
- System gracefully handles mixed encrypted/unencrypted data
- Legacy unencrypted data remains accessible
- New data is automatically encrypted
- No immediate migration required

### Data Migration
To encrypt existing data, run:
```bash
# Future migration script (to be implemented)
npm run encrypt-existing-data
```

## Monitoring & Compliance

### Security Logging
- Encryption/decryption operations are logged
- Failed operations generate error logs
- No sensitive data is logged

### Compliance Ready
This implementation supports:
- GDPR data protection requirements
- SOC 2 security standards
- PCI DSS compliance (for payment data)
- HIPAA compliance (for healthcare data)

## Emergency Procedures

### Key Compromise
If encryption key is compromised:
1. Generate new master key
2. Re-encrypt all sensitive data
3. Update environment variables
4. Restart application services

### Data Recovery
- Ensure regular encrypted backups
- Test backup restoration procedures
- Maintain secure key escrow for recovery
