# Phase 2: Clean Up Scripts - Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 2.1 Deprecated Scripts Directory ✅
**Kept the README.md** for documentation while removing all deprecated scripts:

**Removed runtime helper test scripts:**
- `test-getvar.ts`
- `test-simple-helper.ts`
- `test-runtime-helpers.ts`
- `test-runtime-helper-debug.ts`
- `test-runtime-helpers-detailed.ts`
- `test-runtime-simple.ts`
- `test-single-runtime-helper.ts`
- `test-runtime-api.ts`
- `check-runtime-api-results.ts`

**Removed old execution model scripts:**
- `start-scheduler.ts`
- `test-tool-action.ts`
- `test-real-tools.ts`
- `e2e-tool-actions-test.ts`
- `migrate-templates-to-tool-actions.ts`

### 2.2 Completed Migration Scripts ✅
**Archived to `src/scripts/migrations/archived/`:**
- `add-event-relations-indexes.ts`
- `add-event-relations-indexes-standalone.ts`
- `run-index-migration.sh`

**Removed from `_backups/scripts/`:**
- `migrate-add-execution-fields.ts`
- `migrate-add-execution-tracking.ts`
- `migrate-add-security-columns.ts`
- `migrate-templates-to-tool-actions.ts`
- `encrypt-existing-data.ts`

### 2.3 One-Time Setup Scripts ✅
**Removed dangerous or redundant scripts:**
- `src/scripts/test-new-db.ts`
- `src/scripts/recreate-db.ts`
- `src/scripts/test-db-schema.ts`
- `src/scripts/encrypt-existing-data.ts` (duplicate)

### 2.4 Package.json Scripts Cleanup ✅
**Removed broken npm scripts:**
- `migrate:events`
- `migrate:events:test`
- `migrate:events:dry-run`

These scripts referenced non-existent `src/scripts/migrations/run-migration.ts` file.

## Scripts Preserved

- Kept the `src/scripts/deprecated/README.md` which documents the architectural changes
- Preserved all current test scripts for the new containerized execution model
- Kept utility scripts like `seed-*.ts`, `purge-logs.ts`, `clear-all-logs.ts`
- Maintained scripts for testing the new architecture (`test-container-execution.ts`, `test-sidecar-*.ts`, etc.)

## Linting Status

No new linting errors were introduced by the script cleanup. The existing linting errors remain:
- Log pages still have import errors due to missing client components
- Workflows page still has type inference issues
- These issues are outside the scope of Phase 2 and will be addressed in later phases

## Impact

- **Removed 14 deprecated runtime helper test scripts** that tested the old file-based helper system
- **Removed 5 old execution model scripts** including the old scheduler and tool action tests
- **Archived 3 completed migration scripts** for future reference
- **Removed 5 backup migration scripts** that were completed
- **Removed 4 one-time setup scripts** including dangerous database recreation scripts
- **Fixed package.json** by removing 3 broken migration scripts
