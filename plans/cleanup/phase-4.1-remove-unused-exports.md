# Phase 4.1: Remove Unused Exports - Summary

## Overview

Phase 4.1 focused on cleaning up the `/src/lib/advanced-types.ts` file by removing unused utility types and keeping only the exports that are actively used in the codebase.

## Analysis Results

### Used Exports (Kept)
Based on the DEAD_CODE_ANALYSIS.md and actual import checks, the following exports are being used:
- `isEnumValue` - Used for enum validation
- `assertDefined` - Used for runtime assertions
- `ValidationError` - Custom error class
- `AuthorizationError` - Custom error class  
- `ResourceNotFoundError` - Custom error class
- `EventTypeConfig` - Conditional type for event configuration
- `ConditionalActionConfig` - Conditional type for action configuration
- `PartialBy` - Utility type used in event-form/types.ts
- `FormFieldState` - Used for form field states
- `EventFormState` - Used for form state management
- `EventId`, `ServerId`, `ToolId` - Branded types used in event-form/types.ts

### Unused Types Removed

Successfully removed the following unused types:
- `KeysOfType` - Type utility for extracting keys
- `DeepReadonly` - Deep readonly type utility
- `NonNullableKeys` - Extract non-nullable properties
- `StateTransitions` - State transition mapping
- `EnumToOptions` - Enum to options transformer
- `TransactionCallback` - Database transaction type
- `FormFieldValidation` - Form validation type
- `EnvConfig` - Environment config type
- `RequiredBy` - Make properties required
- `Nullable` - Make properties nullable (defined elsewhere in types/index.ts)
- Branded type creators: `createUserId`, `createEventId`, `createServerId`, `createToolId`
- Utility functions: `pick`, `omit`, `enumToSelectOptions`, `getFirstResult`, `assertQueryResult`, `createUpdateData`

### Types Listed But Not Found
The cleanup plan mentioned several types that don't actually exist in the file:
- `DeepPartial`
- `Mutable`
- `RequireAtLeastOne`
- `RequireOnlyOne`
- `PromiseValue`
- `ArrayElement`
- `Entries`

## File Size Reduction

The advanced-types.ts file was reduced from 562 lines to 364 lines - a 35% reduction in size.

## Verification

- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors after removal
- ✅ All imports verified to ensure no broken dependencies
- ✅ No new linting errors introduced

## Impact

- **Reduced complexity**: Removed 198 lines of unused type definitions
- **Improved maintainability**: Only actively used types remain
- **Cleaner codebase**: Eliminated dead code that could cause confusion

## Changelog Entry

```

## Next Steps

Continue with remaining Phase 4 tasks:
- 4.2: Fix critical security issues (marked as skipping for now)
- 4.3: Complete unfinished features (marked as skipping for now)
- 4.4: Improve error handling
- 4.5: Refactor duplicated code
- 4.6: Configuration management
