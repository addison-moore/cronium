# Phase 1: Remove Deprecated Files - Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1.2 Unused Source Files ✅

- **Removed `/src/lib/ssh-compat.ts`** - SSH compatibility module with no imports
- **Removed `/src/lib/ppr-config.ts`** - Unused Partial Prerendering configuration
- **Removed `CACHE_INVALIDATION_REVIEW.md`** - Already removed (findings implemented)

### 1.3 Empty Directories ✅

- **Removed `/src/app/[lang]/dashboard/(main)/events/test-improved`** - Empty test directory

## Linting Issues Fixed

During the cleanup, several linting errors were discovered and fixed:

1. **Type safety improvements in events page** - Fixed unsafe type assignments and added proper type annotations
2. **Fixed nullish coalescing operators** - Replaced logical OR with nullish coalescing where appropriate
3. **Type improvements in workflows page** - Added proper type casting for execution data
4. **Fixed type inference issues in ServerEventsList** - Corrected parameter typing to avoid TypeScript inference errors

## Issues Discovered

### Broken Log Pages

The log pages (`/logs/page.tsx` and `/logs/[id]/page.tsx`) are currently broken because they're trying to import deleted `page-original` files. These pages need to be rewritten since their client components (`LogsClient` and `LogDetailsClient`) don't exist.

### Remaining Linting Warnings

- Some prettier formatting warnings remain (these are non-critical)
- Unused variable warnings for error handlers (standard pattern)

## Files Removed

1. `/src/lib/ssh-compat.ts`
2. `/src/lib/ppr-config.ts`
3. `/src/app/[lang]/dashboard/(main)/events/test-improved/` (directory)

## Next Steps

1. **Fix broken log pages** - These need to be rewritten without the deleted dependencies
2. **Continue with Phase 2** - Clean up deprecated scripts in the scripts directory
3. **Address remaining TypeScript issues** in the workflows page that still have error type inference

## Changelog Entry

```
- [2025-07-16] [Cleanup] Removed unused files: ssh-compat.ts, ppr-config.ts
- [2025-07-16] [Cleanup] Removed empty test-improved directory
- [2025-07-16] [Bug Fix] Fixed TypeScript type safety issues in events, workflows, and ServerEventsList components
```

## Impact

- Reduced codebase size by removing unused files
- Improved type safety across multiple components
- Identified broken log pages that need attention
