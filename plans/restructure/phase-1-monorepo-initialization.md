# Phase 1: Monorepo Initialization - Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Directory Structure

- Created `apps/` directory for application code
- Created `packages/` directory for shared packages

### 2. Initialized Turborepo

- Created `turbo.json` with pipeline configurations for:
  - build, dev, test, lint, format, typecheck
  - Database operations (db:push, db:generate)
  - Proper caching and dependency management

### 3. Configured PNPM Workspaces

- Created `pnpm-workspace.yaml` including:
  - `apps/*` for applications
  - `packages/*` for shared packages

### 4. Set Up Root package.json

- Renamed to "cronium" with private: true
- Updated scripts to use Turborepo commands
- Removed app-specific dependencies (to be moved to apps/web)
- Added Turborepo as devDependency
- Kept root-level tools (husky, lint-staged, prettier)

### 5. Updated .gitignore

- Added `.turbo/` for Turborepo cache
- Added `dist/` and `build/` for build outputs

### 6. Created Root-Level Configurations

- Created `tsconfig.base.json` for shared TypeScript settings
- Created `.eslintrc.js` for root ESLint configuration
- Kept existing prettier configuration at root

## Current State

The monorepo structure is now initialized with:

- ✅ Turborepo configured and installed
- ✅ PNPM workspaces ready
- ✅ Root package.json cleaned up
- ✅ Base configurations in place
- ✅ Directory structure prepared

## Next Steps

Phase 2 will focus on extracting shared configurations into packages:

- Create packages/config-typescript
- Create packages/config-eslint
- Create packages/config-tailwind
- Update configuration references

## Verification

Ran `pnpm install` successfully - dependencies installed without errors.

No functionality has been changed - the application continues to work as before.
