# Phase 4.5: Create Infrastructure Directory - Summary

## Overview

Added an infrastructure directory (`infra/`) to the monorepo structure to properly organize Docker configurations, deployment scripts, and monitoring configurations as recommended in the Brainstorm.md document.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Infrastructure Directory Structure

```
infra/
├── docker/           # Docker configurations
├── scripts/          # Deployment and utility scripts
└── monitoring/       # Monitoring configurations
```

### 2. Moved Docker Files

Moved all Docker-related files to `infra/docker/`:

- `Dockerfile`
- `.dockerignore`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `docker-compose.dev.yml`
- `docker-compose.dev.local-app.yml`
- `docker-compose.secrets.yml`
- `docker-compose.stack.yml`

### 3. Moved Scripts

Moved all deployment and utility scripts to `infra/scripts/`:

- `build-with-env.sh`
- `dev-docker.sh`
- `dev-docker-local-app.sh`
- `setup-dev.sh`
- `setup-dev-volumes.sh`
- `setup-env.sh`
- `setup-secrets.sh`
- `verify-docker-setup.sh`
- `find-borders.py`
- `log-todos.sh`

### 4. Moved Monitoring Configuration

Moved the monitoring directory with Grafana and Prometheus configurations to `infra/monitoring/`.

### 5. Updated Paths

Updated relative paths in moved files:

- Docker Compose files now use `../../` to reference project files
- Scripts updated to use correct paths for .env files and docker-compose files
- Dockerfile updated to copy monorepo workspace files correctly

### 6. Updated Plan Documentation

Updated the RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md to:

- Include `infra/` in the target structure
- Added Phase 4.5 documenting this infrastructure organization

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation** - Infrastructure files are now clearly separated from application code
2. **Better Organization** - All deployment and Docker configurations in one place
3. **Easier Maintenance** - Infrastructure changes can be made without touching app code
4. **Follows Best Practices** - Aligns with the recommended structure from Brainstorm.md

## Current Structure

The monorepo now has this improved structure:

```
cronium/
├── apps/              # Applications
├── packages/          # Shared packages
├── infra/            # Infrastructure (NEW)
│   ├── docker/       # Docker configs
│   ├── scripts/      # Utility scripts
│   └── monitoring/   # Monitoring setup
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
├── turbo.json
└── package.json
```

## Next Steps

Continue with Phase 5 to migrate the Go services (orchestrator and runtime) to their respective directories in the apps folder.
