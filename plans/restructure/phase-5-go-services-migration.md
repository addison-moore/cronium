# Phase 5: Migrate Go Services - Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Go Service Directories

- Created `apps/orchestrator/` for the orchestrator service
- Created `apps/runtime/` for the runtime service

### 2. Moved Go Code

Successfully moved all Go services while maintaining their structure:

- `orchestrator/cronium-orchestrator/` → `apps/orchestrator/cronium-orchestrator/`
- `runtime/cronium-runtime/` → `apps/runtime/cronium-runtime/`
- `runtime/container-images/` → `apps/runtime/container-images/`
- `runtime/runtime-helpers/` → `apps/runtime/runtime-helpers/`

### 3. Set Up Go Workspace

Created `go.work` file at the root to manage both Go modules:

```
go 1.22

use (
	./apps/orchestrator/cronium-orchestrator
	./apps/runtime/cronium-runtime
)
```

### 4. Updated Docker Configurations

Updated all Docker Compose files to use new paths:

- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Updated orchestrator build context and volumes
- `docker-compose.stack.yml` - Updated build contexts for orchestrator, runtime-api, and main app
- `Dockerfile` - Updated to handle monorepo structure

### 5. Updated Build Scripts

Updated `infra/scripts/setup-dev.sh`:

- Go build commands now reference correct paths
- Docker Compose commands updated to use infra/docker path

### 6. Configured Turborepo Pipeline

- Added Go-specific tasks to `turbo.json`:
  - `build:go` - Build Go binaries with caching
  - `test:go` - Run Go tests with coverage output
  - `lint:go` - Run Go linters
- Created `package.json` files for both Go services to integrate with Turborepo

## Current State

The Go services are now fully integrated into the monorepo:

- ✅ Orchestrator service in `apps/orchestrator/`
- ✅ Runtime service in `apps/runtime/`
- ✅ Go workspace configured
- ✅ Docker configurations updated
- ✅ Build scripts updated
- ✅ Turborepo integration complete

## Benefits

1. **Unified Build System** - Go services can be built using Turborepo alongside Node.js apps
2. **Consistent Structure** - All applications follow the same organizational pattern
3. **Better Caching** - Turborepo caches Go builds for faster development
4. **Simplified CI/CD** - Single pipeline can handle all services
5. **Cross-Service Development** - Easier to work on features that span multiple services

## Next Steps

Phase 6 will update the build and development workflows to ensure all commands work properly with the new monorepo structure.

## Verification

- Go workspace file created and references both modules
- Docker paths updated and tested
- Build scripts updated with correct paths
- Turborepo can now orchestrate Go builds alongside JavaScript builds
