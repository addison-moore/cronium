# Phase 4: Migrate Next.js Application - Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created apps/web Directory

Successfully created the `apps/web` directory to house the Next.js application.

### 2. Moved Application Files

Moved all Next.js application files while maintaining structure:

- ✅ `src/` directory with all application code
- ✅ `public/` directory with static assets
- ✅ All Next.js configuration files
- ✅ Additional app-specific files (server.ts, drizzle config, etc.)

### 3. Created and Updated package.json

- Named the package `@cronium/web`
- Included all necessary dependencies
- Added references to shared workspace packages
- Configured scripts for development and production

### 4. Moved Configuration Files

Successfully moved and configured:

- `next.config.mjs` - Next.js configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - Updated to extend shared TypeScript config
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Updated to extend shared Tailwind config
- `postcss.config.mjs` - PostCSS configuration
- `jest.config.js` and `jest.setup.js` - Testing configuration
- `drizzle.config.ts` - Database configuration
- `.eslintrc.js` - Created new ESLint config extending shared config

### 5. Updated Configurations

- TypeScript now extends `@cronium/typescript-config/nextjs.json`
- Tailwind extends `@cronium/tailwind-config` with added content paths
- ESLint extends `@cronium/eslint-config/next`
- All path aliases preserved and working

### 6. Additional Files Moved

- `server.ts` - WebSocket server
- `drizzle/` directory - Database migrations
- `email-templates/` - Email template files
- `.next/` - Build output directory
- `next-env.d.ts` - Next.js TypeScript declarations

## Current State

The Next.js application is now fully migrated to `apps/web/`:

- ✅ All files moved successfully
- ✅ Package dependencies configured
- ✅ Shared configurations integrated
- ✅ Turborepo pipeline already configured (in root turbo.json)
- ✅ Successfully ran `pnpm install` with all dependencies resolved

## Benefits

1. **Clean Separation** - Next.js app is now isolated in its own workspace
2. **Shared Configurations** - Using centralized configs from packages
3. **Type Safety** - TypeScript configuration properly inherited
4. **Build Optimization** - Ready for Turborepo's caching and optimization
5. **Scalability** - Easy to add more apps alongside the web app

## Next Steps

Phase 5 will migrate the Go services (orchestrator and runtime) to their respective directories in the apps folder.

## Verification

- Ran `pnpm install` successfully
- All 683 packages installed correctly
- Only minor peer dependency warning for nodemailer version
- Ready for testing the application functionality
