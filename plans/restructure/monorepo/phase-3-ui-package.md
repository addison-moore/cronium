# Phase 3: Create UI Package - Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created UI Package Structure

**Location:** `packages/ui/`

Created a complete UI package structure with:

- `src/` directory for source code
- `src/utils/` for utility functions
- Proper package exports configuration

### 2. Package Configuration

Created `package.json` with:

- Proper exports for both CommonJS and ESM
- TypeScript types support
- Peer dependencies for React
- Build tools (tsup) and development dependencies
- Scripts for build, dev, lint, and typecheck

### 3. TypeScript Configuration

- Extended from `@cronium/typescript-config/library.json`
- Configured for component library development
- Fixed incremental compilation issue for library builds

### 4. Tailwind CSS Setup

- Created Tailwind configuration extending shared config
- Added PostCSS configuration
- Created base styles.css file with Tailwind directives

### 5. Initial Exports

Created initial exports:

- `cn` utility function for className merging (commonly used in component libraries)
- Prepared structure for future component exports

### 6. Build Process

- Configured tsup for building the package
- Supports both CommonJS and ESM output
- Generates TypeScript declarations
- Successfully builds without errors

### 7. Additional Configuration

- ESLint configuration for the UI package
- Proper .gitignore patterns inherited from root

## Current State

The UI package is fully set up and ready for components:

- ✅ Package structure created
- ✅ Build process working
- ✅ TypeScript configured
- ✅ Tailwind CSS ready
- ✅ Exports configured properly
- ✅ Successfully builds with `pnpm build`

## Benefits

1. **Ready for Components** - Structure is in place to start migrating shared components
2. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support with proper declarations
3. **Modern Build** - Supports both CommonJS and ESM formats
4. **Styling Ready** - Tailwind CSS configured and ready to use
5. **Developer Experience** - Hot reload support with `pnpm dev`

## Next Steps

Phase 4 will migrate the entire Next.js application to `apps/cronium-app/`, which will then be able to import from this UI package.

## Verification

- Built successfully with `pnpm build` in the UI package
- No TypeScript errors
- No linting errors
- Package properly linked in the workspace
