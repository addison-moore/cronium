# Phase 3: Content Migration - Complete

Phase 3 of the cronium app separation has been successfully completed. All landing page and documentation content has been migrated to the new cronium-info app.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Landing Page Migration ✅

- Copied `page.tsx` from cronium-app to cronium-info
- Removed auth-related elements (signup button from CTA section)

### 2. Documentation Pages Migration ✅

- Copied entire docs directory structure (23 files total)
- Maintained exact same directory structure and file names
- All page.tsx files, layout, loading, error, and not-found pages copied
- API examples TypeScript files preserved

### 3. Landing Components Migration ✅

- Moved 4 landing components to cronium-info:
  - `hero.tsx` - Hero section with animated dashboard preview
  - `navbar.tsx` - Navigation bar (auth elements removed)
  - `Features.tsx` - Feature showcase section
  - `footer.tsx` - Footer with links and social media

### 4. Docs Components Migration ✅

- Moved `api-code-examples.tsx` to cronium-info
- Note: `docs-layout.tsx` was not found in cronium-app (likely using the default layout.tsx)

### 5. Public Assets Migration ✅

- Copied necessary assets:
  - Logo files (icon0.svg, icon1.png, logo-icon.png, logo-icon.svg)
  - Programming language icons (bash.svg, nodejs.svg, python.svg)
  - favicon.ico
- Skipped non-essential files (integrations, web-app-manifest)

### 6. Translation Files ✅

- Created minimal translation files containing only relevant sections:
  - Nav section for navigation
  - Footer section
  - Home section for landing page
  - Documentation section
  - Common section for basic UI text
- Both en.json and es.json created with appropriate fallbacks

### 7. Component Import Updates ✅

- All components already using @cronium/ui for shared components
- No additional import updates required

### 8. Auth Elements Removal ✅

- Removed sign-in/sign-up buttons from navbar (both desktop and mobile views)
- Removed sign-up CTA button from landing page
- Removed LogIn and UserPlus icon imports

## File Changes Summary

### Files Created in cronium-info:

- `/app/[lang]/page.tsx` - Landing page
- `/app/[lang]/docs/` - 23 documentation files
- `/components/landing/` - 4 components
- `/components/docs/api-code-examples.tsx`
- `/public/assets/` - Logo and icon files
- `/messages/en.json` and `/messages/es.json`

### Files Modified:

- `/components/landing/navbar.tsx` - Auth elements removed
- `/app/[lang]/page.tsx` - Sign-up CTA removed

## Notes

1. The `useLanguage` import was removed from hero.tsx as this provider doesn't exist in cronium-info
2. Spanish translations use English as fallback where translations weren't available
3. All components maintain the same styling and functionality as the originals

## Next Steps

Phase 3 is complete. The cronium-info app now has all the content needed for the marketing/documentation site. Ready to proceed with Phase 4: Routing and Navigation Updates.
