# Phase 4: Routing and Navigation Updates - Complete

Phase 4 of the cronium app separation has been successfully completed. All routing and navigation has been updated to separate the landing/docs from the main application.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Cronium-App Cleanup ✅

- Deleted landing page (`apps/cronium-app/src/app/[lang]/page.tsx`)
- Deleted entire docs directory (`apps/cronium-app/src/app/[lang]/docs/`)
- Deleted landing components directory (`apps/cronium-app/src/components/landing/`)
- Deleted docs components directory (`apps/cronium-app/src/components/docs/`)

### 2. New Root Page ✅

Created a new root page that:

- Checks if user is authenticated using `getServerSession`
- Redirects authenticated users to `/[lang]/dashboard`
- Redirects unauthenticated users to `/[lang]/auth/signin`

### 3. Middleware Updates ✅

- Verified middleware.ts doesn't have any special docs route handling
- Root redirect logic already works correctly with the new page

### 4. Navigation Updates ✅

- Checked dashboard navigation - no docs links found
- Updated API documentation link in settings to point to external docs site
- Changed from internal link (`/docs/api`) to external link (`https://docs.cronium.dev/docs/api`)

### 5. Cronium-Info Routing Verification ✅

- Confirmed dev server starts successfully on port 3001
- Landing page accessible at `/en`
- Documentation pages accessible at `/en/docs`
- Language switching functional
- All internal navigation works

### 6. URL Updates ✅

- Found and updated one hardcoded `/docs` reference in api-tokens page
- No other internal docs links found in the codebase

## Code Quality Fixes

### TypeScript Errors Fixed:

1. Fixed auth import in root page (changed to use `getServerSession` from next-auth)
2. Fixed CodeViewer export in UI package (changed to named export)
3. Fixed Spinner import to use @cronium/ui

### Files Modified:

- `/apps/cronium-app/src/app/[lang]/page.tsx` - New redirect page
- `/apps/cronium-app/src/app/[lang]/dashboard/(main)/settings/api-tokens/page.tsx` - External docs link
- `/apps/cronium-app/src/components/event-details/EventDetailsTab.tsx` - CodeViewer import
- `/apps/cronium-app/src/components/logs/LogDetails.tsx` - CodeViewer import
- `/apps/cronium-app/src/components/workflows/WorkflowCanvas.tsx` - Spinner import
- `/packages/ui/src/components/code-viewer.tsx` - Named export

## Notes

1. Linting fails due to missing environment variables, which is expected in the build environment
2. All TypeScript errors have been resolved
3. Both apps can run concurrently without conflicts
4. The separation is now complete from a routing perspective

## Next Steps

Phase 4 is complete. The cronium-app now redirects to authentication/dashboard, while cronium-info serves the landing page and documentation. Ready to proceed with Phase 5: Build and Configuration Updates.
