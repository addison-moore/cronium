# Phase 1.3: Update Docker Compose Configuration - Summary

## Overview

Phase 1.3 of the revised runtime helpers plan has been completed successfully. This phase focused on updating the Docker Compose configuration to include the necessary runtime API settings for the orchestrator.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Runtime Configuration Update

- ✅ Added missing `CRONIUM_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_IMAGE` environment variable
- ✅ Set to use the newly built `cronium/runtime-api:latest` image
- ✅ Verified other runtime configurations were already present:
  - `CRONIUM_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_JWT_SECRET`
  - `CRONIUM_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_BACKEND_URL`
  - `CRONIUM_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_VALKEY_URL`

### 2. Valkey Service Verification

- ✅ Confirmed Valkey service is properly configured
- ✅ Using `valkey/valkey:7-alpine` image
- ✅ Has health checks configured
- ✅ Connected to the cronium-network
- ✅ Persistent volume mounted at `/data`
- ✅ Memory limits and eviction policy configured

### 3. Network Connectivity Verification

- ✅ All services are on the same `cronium-network`
- ✅ Service discovery is properly configured:
  - cronium-agent → cronium-app via `http://cronium-app:5001`
  - cronium-agent → valkey via `valkey://valkey:6379`
  - cronium-app → all other services by name
- ✅ Health checks ensure services are ready before dependencies start

## Technical Details

### Configuration Added

```yaml
CRONIUM_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_IMAGE: cronium/runtime-api:latest
```

### Complete Runtime Configuration in cronium-agent

```yaml
# Container Configuration
CRONIUM_CONTAINER_DOCKER_ENDPOINT: unix:///var/run/docker.sock
CRONIUM_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_IMAGE: cronium/runtime-api:latest
CRONIUM_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_JWT_SECRET: ${JWT_SECRET}
CRONIUM_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_BACKEND_URL: http://cronium-app:5001
CRONIUM_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_VALKEY_URL: valkey://valkey:6379
```

### Service Dependencies

The docker-compose configuration ensures proper startup order:

1. postgres and valkey start first
2. cronium-agent waits for healthy status
3. cronium-app waits for all dependencies to be healthy

## Architecture Integration

With this configuration:

- The orchestrator knows which Runtime API image to use for sidecars
- The Runtime API sidecars will connect to the correct backend and cache
- JWT secrets are shared for secure communication
- All services can communicate via the Docker network

## Next Steps

With Phase 1.3 complete, the infrastructure configuration is ready. The next phase will involve testing the container execution flow to ensure events can execute properly with the runtime helpers.

## Human Intervention Required

As noted in the plan, the following requires human intervention:

- ~~Generate and set JWT_SECRET environment variable~~ ✅ Already set in `.env.local`
- Ensure Docker daemon is running and accessible

**Note**: The project uses `.env.local` for environment variables. When running Docker Compose:

- Use `pnpm dev:docker` which automatically uses `--env-file .env.local`
- Or manually specify: `docker-compose --env-file .env.local up`

## Notes

- The configuration was mostly complete; only one environment variable was missing
- No changes were needed to the Valkey or network configuration
- No new linting errors were introduced
- The system is now configured to create Runtime API sidecars for each job execution
