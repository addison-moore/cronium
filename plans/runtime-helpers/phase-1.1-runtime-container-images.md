# Phase 1.1: Build Runtime Container Images - Summary

## Overview

Phase 1.1 of the revised runtime helpers plan has been completed successfully. This phase focused on building the required Docker images for runtime execution.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Navigation and Review

- ✅ Navigated to `/runtime/container-images/` directory
- ✅ Reviewed the structure and found:
  - Base image Dockerfile
  - Language-specific Dockerfiles for Bash, Python, and Node.js
  - Build script (`build-images.sh`)
  - Runtime helper files for each language

### 2. Dockerfile Review

- ✅ Reviewed all Dockerfiles:
  - **Base Image**: Alpine-based with security hardening
  - **Bash Image**: Alpine with bash, curl, jq, and coreutils
  - **Python Image**: Python 3.12-slim with requests and aiohttp
  - **Node.js Image**: Node 20-alpine with axios

### 3. Build Process

- ✅ Executed the build script with minor fixes:
  - Fixed Python Dockerfile to handle missing packages gracefully
  - Fixed Node.js Dockerfile to handle existing user/group IDs
  - Successfully built all three language images

### 4. Image Tagging

- ✅ Tagged images with orchestrator-expected names:
  - `cronium/bash:latest` → `cronium/runner:bash-alpine`
  - `cronium/python:latest` → `cronium/runner:python-alpine`
  - `cronium/nodejs:latest` → `cronium/runner:node-alpine`

### 5. Runtime Helper Verification

- ✅ Verified all images contain runtime helpers:
  - Bash: `/usr/local/bin/cronium.sh` present and executable
  - Python: `cronium` module importable from site-packages
  - Node.js: `cronium` module loadable from `/usr/local/lib`

## Technical Details

### Image Sizes

- `cronium/runner:bash-alpine`: 18.1MB
- `cronium/runner:node-alpine`: 137MB
- `cronium/runner:python-alpine`: 148MB

### Security Features

All images include:

- Non-root user (`cronium`) with UID/GID 1000
- Removed package managers post-installation
- Disabled setuid/setgid binaries
- Minimal attack surface
- Health check scripts

### Runtime Helper Integration

Each image has the HTTP-based runtime helper pre-installed:

- Helpers expect `CRONIUM_EXECUTION_TOKEN` environment variable
- Helpers communicate with Runtime API via HTTP
- All helpers support the full API (input/output, variables, conditions)

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

1. **Python Dockerfile**: Attempted to remove packages that weren't installed
   - **Solution**: Added `|| true` to allow graceful failure

2. **Node.js Dockerfile**: GID 1000 already in use by default node user
   - **Solution**: Modified to use existing group or create new one

3. **Build Script**: Created additional image variants we don't need
   - **Solution**: Manually built only the required images

## Next Steps

With Phase 1.1 complete, the next step is Phase 1.2: Build Runtime API Image. This will create the sidecar container that provides the Runtime API service for the runtime helpers to communicate with.

## Pre-existing Issues

Note: The codebase has pre-existing linting errors unrelated to this phase:

- TypeScript type assertion warnings
- Unsafe assignments in error handling
- Prettier formatting issues

These should be addressed in a separate cleanup task.
