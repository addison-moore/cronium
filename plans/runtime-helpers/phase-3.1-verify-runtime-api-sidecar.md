# Phase 3.1: Verify Runtime API Sidecar - Summary

## Overview

Phase 3.1 of the revised runtime helpers plan has been completed successfully. This phase focused on verifying that the Runtime API sidecar container starts properly with jobs and is accessible from the job containers.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Confirm Sidecar Container Starts with Job

- ✅ Verified sidecar containers are created for each job execution
- ✅ Sidecar naming pattern: `cronium-runtime-job_<jobId>`
- ✅ Sidecar starts in the same isolated network as the job
- ✅ Sidecar also connects to the development network (for Valkey access)

### 2. Check Sidecar Accessibility

- ✅ Sidecar is reachable via hostname `runtime-api` within the job network
- ✅ Health endpoint responds at `http://runtime-api:8081/health`
- ✅ Fixed seccomp profile issue that was preventing main container startup
- ✅ Main containers can now execute successfully alongside sidecars

### 3. Verify JWT Token Generation and Injection

- ✅ Token is generated by the orchestrator using the configured JWT secret
- ✅ Token is stored in the orchestrator's memory for the job duration
- ✅ Token is injected into main container as `CRONIUM_EXECUTION_TOKEN`
- ✅ Runtime helpers correctly look for this environment variable

### 4. Test Sidecar API Endpoints

- ✅ Health endpoint is accessible without authentication
- ✅ Sidecar starts successfully and passes internal health checks
- ✅ Logs show: "Runtime sidecar started successfully"
- ✅ Both containers run in the isolated job network

### 5. Ensure Sidecar Cleanup

- ✅ Sidecars are properly stopped after job completion
- ✅ Job networks are removed after execution
- ✅ Token is cleared from orchestrator memory
- ✅ No orphaned containers or networks remain

## Technical Details

### Environment Variables in Main Container

```bash
CRONIUM_JOB_ID=job_xxxxx
CRONIUM_JOB_TYPE=SCRIPT
CRONIUM_EXECUTION_MODE=container
CRONIUM_EXECUTION_ID=job_xxxxx
CRONIUM_EXECUTION_TOKEN=<jwt-token>
CRONIUM_RUNTIME_API=http://runtime-api:8081
```

### Sidecar Configuration

- Image: `cronium/runtime-api:latest`
- Port: 8081 (internal only)
- Networks: Job-specific network + development network (in dev mode)
- Resources: 256MB memory, 0.5 CPU
- Security: Read-only root filesystem, non-root user

### Issues Fixed During Phase

1. **Seccomp Profile Error**: Modified executor to skip adding "default" seccomp profile
2. **Log Reading Error**: Identified "Failed to read container logs" error (non-critical)
3. **Network Access**: Ensured sidecar connects to both networks for service access

## Verification Results

From test executions:

```
[INFO] Runtime sidecar started successfully containerID=a39bcaf21ed7... jobID=job_9dy0wLvZmvpC
[INFO] Job completed exitCode=0 jobID=job_9dy0wLvZmvpC
```

## Next Steps

With the sidecar verified as working, the next phase is:

- **Phase 3.2**: Test Runtime Helper Functions - Verify the actual runtime helper functions work correctly

## Notes

- The sidecar health check passes consistently
- JWT tokens are being generated and injected properly
- The main container execution issue (seccomp) has been resolved
- Log streaming has an intermittent issue but doesn't affect job execution
- The system is ready for testing actual runtime helper functionality
