# Phase 3.2: Test Runtime Helper Functions - Summary

## Overview

Phase 3.2 of the runtime helpers implementation has been completed. This phase focused on testing all runtime helper functions to verify they work correctly in the containerized environment.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Container Log Capture Issue

- **Problem**: Container logs were not being captured due to a race condition in the orchestrator
- **Solution**: Added synchronization using `sync.WaitGroup` to ensure all logs are collected before marking jobs as complete
- **Result**: Logs are now successfully captured and stored in the database

### 2. Fixed API Endpoint for Job Completion

- **Problem**: Orchestrator was sending logs in a different format than the API expected
- **Solution**: Updated the complete job endpoint to handle both string and object formats for output
- **Result**: Job logs are properly stored in the result field

### 3. Created Comprehensive Test Scripts

- **test-runtime-helpers.ts**: Tests all runtime helper functions
- **test-runtime-helpers-detailed.ts**: Provides detailed debugging output
- **test-runtime-simple.ts**: Basic container execution test
- **check-job-logs.ts**: Utility to view job logs from database
- **check-test-jobs.ts**: Utility to find and display test job results

## Test Results

### Container Execution ✅

- Containers start successfully with runtime helpers installed
- Environment variables are properly injected (CRONIUM_RUNTIME_API, CRONIUM_EXECUTION_TOKEN, etc.)
- Logs are captured and stored in the database

### Runtime API Connectivity ✅

- Runtime API sidecar is accessible from job containers
- Health endpoint responds without authentication
- JWT tokens are generated and injected properly

### Runtime Helper Functions ⚠️

- Helper scripts are found at `/usr/local/bin/cronium.sh`
- Functions are callable but return errors
- Error: "API request failed - execution ID mismatch"
- This indicates the runtime API is validating the execution ID from the JWT token

## Technical Details

### Log Capture Fix

```go
// Added synchronization to wait for log streaming
var logWg sync.WaitGroup
logWg.Add(1)
go func() {
    defer logWg.Done()
    e.streamLogs(ctx, containerID, updates)
}()

// Wait for logs before sending completion
logWg.Wait()
```

### API Endpoint Update

```typescript
// Handle both formats: string or {stdout, stderr}
if (typeof body.output === "string") {
  output = body.output;
} else {
  output = body.output.stdout;
  if (body.output.stderr) {
    output += "\n--- STDERR ---\n" + body.output.stderr;
  }
}
```

```

## Issues Identified

1. **Execution ID Mismatch**: The runtime API is rejecting requests with "execution ID mismatch"
   - The JWT token contains the correct execution ID
   - The runtime API may be expecting a different ID format or validation

2. **Variable Storage**: The setVariable function is not creating new variables
   - This is likely related to the execution ID validation issue

3. **Python Runtime**: Python runtime helper tests are failing
   - Need to verify Python runtime image has the helper installed correctly

## Next Steps (Phase 3.3)

1. Debug the execution ID validation in the runtime API
2. Fix the mismatch between what the orchestrator sends and what the API expects
3. Verify all runtime helper endpoints work correctly
4. Test Python and Node.js runtime helpers
5. Ensure data persistence (variables, conditions, output)

## Notes

- Container log capture is now working reliably
- The runtime infrastructure is in place and functional
- The main blocker is the execution ID validation in the runtime API
- Once this is fixed, all runtime helper functions should work correctly
