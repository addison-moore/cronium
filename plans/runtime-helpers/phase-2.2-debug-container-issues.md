# Phase 2.2: Debug Container Issues - Summary

## Overview

Phase 2.2 of the revised runtime helpers plan has been completed successfully. This phase focused on debugging and fixing the runtime sidecar container health check failures that were preventing proper runtime helper functionality.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Review Orchestrator Logs

- ✅ Identified the error: "runtime sidecar health check failed: container stopped unexpectedly"
- ✅ Found multiple failed sidecar creation attempts
- ✅ Discovered the containers were exiting immediately after creation

### 2. Docker Container Status Analysis

- ✅ Created monitoring scripts to capture sidecar containers before removal
- ✅ Used Docker events API to track container lifecycle
- ✅ Successfully captured container logs showing the root cause

### 3. Network Issue Discovery

- ✅ Found that sidecars were created in isolated job-specific networks
- ✅ Discovered the error: "failed to connect to Valkey: dial tcp: lookup valkey on 127.0.0.11:53: server misbehaving"
- ✅ Identified that the sidecar couldn't reach Valkey service in the development network

### 4. Root Cause Analysis

The runtime sidecar containers were failing because:

1. Each job creates an isolated network (e.g., `cronium-job-job_ABC123`)
2. The sidecar was configured to connect to `valkey://valkey:6379`
3. The Valkey service (`cronium-valkey-dev`) was in a different network (`cronium-dev_cronium-dev-network`)
4. DNS resolution failed because the isolated network couldn't resolve the hostname

### 5. Solution Implementation

Fixed the issue by:

1. **Updated docker-compose.dev.yml**: Changed `CRONIUM_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_VALKEY_URL` to use the correct hostname
2. **Modified sidecar.go**: Added logic to connect sidecars to the development network in development mode:
   ```go
   // Connect to shared services network if in development mode
   if os.Getenv("GO_ENV") == "development" {
       if err := sm.executor.dockerClient.NetworkConnect(ctx, "cronium-dev_cronium-dev-network", resp.ID, nil); err != nil {
           sm.log.WithError(err).Warn("Failed to connect sidecar to development network")
       }
   }
   ```

## Technical Details

### Debugging Tools Created

1. **debug-sidecar.ts**: Monitored for sidecar containers in real-time
2. **monitor-docker-events.sh**: Captured Docker events for sidecar containers
3. **debug-sidecar-network.ts**: Captured detailed network configuration and logs
4. **verify-sidecar-working.ts**: Verified the fix was working

### Key Findings

- Container exit code was 1 (error)
- Logs showed: `{"error":"failed to connect to Valkey: dial tcp: lookup valkey on 127.0.0.11:53: server misbehaving"}`
- Containers were in isolated networks with no access to shared services
- The fix allows sidecars to access both the job network and the development network

### Verification Results

After implementing the fix:

```
[INFO] Runtime sidecar started successfully containerID=0c7a975b0846... jobID=job_aFaOPXaO1pA8
```

## Next Steps

With the sidecar now working properly, the system is ready for:

1. **Phase 2.3**: Fix any remaining container execution problems
2. **Phase 3**: Runtime Helper Integration - test actual runtime helper functionality

## Notes

- The fix is development-specific using `GO_ENV=development`
- In production, a different approach may be needed (e.g., external cache or no cache)
- The sidecar now has access to both networks, maintaining isolation while allowing service access
- Fixed Go linting error in sidecar_test.go (removed unused import)
- No TypeScript errors introduced
