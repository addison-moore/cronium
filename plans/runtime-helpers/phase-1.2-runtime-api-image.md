# Phase 1.2: Build Runtime API Image - Summary

## Overview

Phase 1.2 of the revised runtime helpers plan has been completed successfully. This phase focused on building the Runtime API Docker image that will serve as the sidecar container for runtime helper communication.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Navigation and Discovery

- ✅ Navigated to `/runtime/cronium-runtime/` directory
- ✅ Found a complete Go service implementation
- ✅ Reviewed README.md to understand service architecture
- ✅ Confirmed no Dockerfile existed

### 2. Dockerfile Creation

- ✅ Created a multi-stage Dockerfile with:
  - **Build stage**: Uses golang:1.24-alpine for compilation
  - **Runtime stage**: Uses alpine:3.19 for minimal runtime
  - Proper security configuration (non-root user)
  - Health check endpoint configuration
  - Tini for proper signal handling

### 3. Build Process

- ✅ Successfully built the image without errors
- ✅ Tagged as `cronium/runtime-api:latest`
- ✅ Build completed in reasonable time with proper caching

### 4. Image Verification

- ✅ Verified binary exists at `/app/cronium-runtime`
- ✅ Confirmed config.yaml is included
- ✅ Verified correct file permissions (cronium user ownership)
- ✅ Image size is optimal at 19.7MB

### 5. Runtime Testing

- ✅ Confirmed binary attempts to start (fails on missing env vars as expected)
- ✅ Verified all required files are present in the container
- ✅ Health check endpoint configured correctly

## Technical Details

### Image Characteristics

- **Base Image**: Alpine 3.19 (minimal and secure)
- **Size**: 19.7MB (excellent for a Go service)
- **User**: Non-root user `cronium` (UID/GID 1000)
- **Port**: 8081 exposed
- **Entry Point**: Uses tini for proper signal handling

### Required Environment Variables

The service requires these environment variables to start:

- `RUNTIME_JWT_SECRET` - JWT signing secret
- `RUNTIME_BACKEND_URL` - Cronium backend API URL
- `RUNTIME_BACKEND_TOKEN` - Backend authentication token
- `RUNTIME_VALKEY_URL` - Valkey/Redis connection URL

### Dockerfile Features

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for optimal size
# Security hardening with non-root user
# Health check for container orchestration
# Proper signal handling with tini
# Minimal attack surface with Alpine
```

## Architecture Integration

The Runtime API service will act as a sidecar container providing:

- JWT-authenticated API endpoints for runtime helpers
- Caching layer via Valkey/Redis
- Proxy to backend API for persistent storage
- Rate limiting and security features

## Next Steps

With Phase 1.2 complete, the next step is Phase 1.3: Update Docker Compose Configuration. This will integrate the Runtime API service into the local development environment with proper configuration.

## Notes

- The image builds successfully and contains all necessary components
- The service cannot start without proper backend connections (expected)
- No new linting errors were introduced during this phase
- Pre-existing TypeScript linting errors remain in the codebase
