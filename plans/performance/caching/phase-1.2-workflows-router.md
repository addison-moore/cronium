# Phase 1.2 Summary: Workflows Router Cache Removal

## Date

2025-07-16

## Overview

Successfully removed all caching from the Workflows Router as part of the caching simplification plan.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Cache Imports

- Removed import of `cachedQueries` and `cacheInvalidation` from the cache middleware
- The router no longer has any dependency on the caching infrastructure

### 2. Updated Query Methods

#### `getAll` Query

- Removed `cachedQueries.workflowList` wrapper
- Now makes direct calls to `storage.getAllWorkflows()`
- Filtering and pagination logic remains unchanged
- Data is always fresh from the database

#### `getById` Query

- Removed `cachedQueries.workflowById` wrapper
- Now makes direct calls to `storage.getWorkflowWithRelations()`
- Permission checks remain in place
- No caching layer between request and database

### 3. Cache Invalidation

- No cache invalidation was implemented in the workflows router (despite using cached queries)
- This confirms the analysis that the caching implementation was incomplete
- No invalidation code needed to be removed

## Key Observations

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The workflows router was using cached queries for reads but had zero cache invalidation on any mutations (create, update, delete, archive, bulk operations). This would have caused severe stale data issues.

2. **No Performance Impact Expected**: Since the router already lacked proper invalidation, users were likely experiencing stale data. Removing caching ensures data freshness without changing performance characteristics.

3. **Cleaner Code**: The removal of caching wrappers makes the code more straightforward and easier to understand.

## Files Modified

- `/src/server/api/routers/workflows.ts`

## Checklist Items Completed

- [x] Remove caching from `list` query (actually named `getAll`)
- [x] Remove caching from `getById` query
- [x] Remove caching from `getByIdWithDetails` query (not found - only `getAll` and `getById`)
- [x] Remove all cache invalidation logic (none existed)
- [x] Update to use direct storage calls

## Next Steps

- Continue with Phase 1.3: Remove caching from other routers
- Monitor for any performance impacts
- Ensure all workflow operations return fresh data
