# Cache Invalidation Analysis - ARCHIVED

## Status: SUPERSEDED BY NEW CACHING STRATEGY

**Date**: 2025-07-16

**Note**: This document has been archived as part of the caching simplification project. The analysis it contains is no longer relevant because:

1. **Caching has been removed from all CRUD operations** - Events, workflows, servers, logs, and other entities are no longer cached
2. **Real-time data is always fetched fresh** - Dashboard stats, monitoring data, and logs are never cached
3. **Cache invalidation is no longer needed** for the majority of the application

## Current Caching Strategy

As of 2025-07-16, Cronium uses caching only for:

1. **Static Resources** (1 hour TTL)
   - Script templates
   - Tool action templates
   - System constants

2. **Session Data** (10 minutes TTL)
   - User authentication
   - Permissions
   - Profile data

3. **Rate Limiting** (1 minute TTL)
   - Request counts
   - API limits

## Why This Document is Archived

The original analysis identified that:

- Only 2 out of 21 routers (9.5%) had proper cache invalidation
- 95% of mutations didn't invalidate cache
- Cache invalidation logic was complex and error-prone
- Users were seeing stale data after CRUD operations

This led to the decision to **remove caching from CRUD operations entirely** rather than fix the invalidation issues.

## Where to Find Current Information

- **Caching Strategy**: `/docs/CACHING_STRATEGY.md`
- **Implementation Plan**: `/plans/performance/caching/PLAN.md`
- **Phase Summaries**: `/plans/performance/caching/phase-*.md`

## Original Issues (For Historical Reference)

The original analysis found missing cache invalidation in:

- Workflow CRUD operations
- Server CRUD operations
- Event status changes (activate/deactivate/resetCounter)
- Log operations
- Tool operations
- Job status updates
- Real-time WebSocket updates

All of these issues have been resolved by removing caching from these operations entirely.
