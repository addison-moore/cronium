# Phase 3 Complete: Cache Infrastructure Cleanup

## Date

2025-07-16

## Overview

Successfully completed Phase 3 and portions of Phase 5 of the caching simplification plan. Removed all unused cache infrastructure, including middleware, query wrappers, and invalidation helpers that were no longer needed after removing caching from CRUD operations.

## Changes Made

### Phase 3: Clean Up Cache Infrastructure

#### Cache Middleware (`/src/server/api/middleware/cache.ts`)

- ✅ Removed `cachedQueries` object containing pre-configured cache queries for:
  - dashboardStats
  - eventList, eventById
  - workflowList, workflowById
  - serverList, serverById
- ✅ Removed `cacheInvalidation` object containing invalidation helpers for:
  - invalidateEvent
  - invalidateWorkflow
  - invalidateServer
  - invalidateLogs
- ✅ Removed helper functions:
  - `createCacheKey` - No longer needed for procedure caching
  - `createCachedQuery` - Query wrapper factory removed
- ✅ Kept `withCache` function for potential future selective caching

#### tRPC Configuration (`/src/server/api/trpc.ts`)

- ✅ Removed `withCache` middleware that provided in-memory caching
- ✅ Removed associated types and cache management logic
- ✅ Added comment explaining the removal

#### Storage Layer

- ✅ Already cleaned in Phase 1 (getEventWithRelations)

### Phase 5 (Partial): Update Cache Service

#### Cache Service (`/src/lib/cache/cache-service.ts`)

- ✅ Updated `CACHE_PREFIXES` to keep only:
  - USER (for session/auth caching)
  - RATE_LIMIT (for rate limiting)
  - STATIC (for static resources)
- ✅ Updated `CACHE_TTL` to keep only:
  - USER: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
  - RATE_LIMIT: 60 seconds (1 minute)
  - STATIC: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- ✅ Simplified `invalidateUserCache` to only clear user session data
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors by updating default TTL references

#### Documentation Updates

- ✅ Updated `/src/trpc/README.md` to reflect removal of withCache middleware
- ✅ Added notes about caching simplification

## Key Observations

1. **Minimal Infrastructure Remaining**: After cleanup, only the core cache service remains with support for session caching, rate limiting, and potential static resource caching.

2. **Clean Separation**: The cache service is now completely decoupled from business logic, making it easier to maintain and understand.

3. **Type Safety Maintained**: Fixed all TypeScript errors that arose from removing cache constants.

4. **Documentation Accuracy**: Updated documentation to prevent confusion about removed features.

## Files Modified

- `/src/server/api/middleware/cache.ts` - Removed most content, kept only withCache function
- `/src/server/api/trpc.ts` - Removed withCache middleware
- `/src/lib/cache/cache-service.ts` - Simplified prefixes and TTLs
- `/src/trpc/README.md` - Updated documentation

## Remaining Cache Infrastructure

### What's Left:

1. **Core Cache Service** - Redis/Valkey connection and basic operations
2. **withCache Function** - Generic wrapper for selective caching
3. **Rate Limiting** - Still uses Redis for tracking request counts
4. **Session Caching** - For authentication performance

### Use Cases:

- **Session/Auth Data** - Reduce database lookups for user sessions
- **Rate Limiting** - Track API usage per user/IP
- **Static Resources** - Future use for templates, configurations
- **Temporary Data** - Any future needs for short-term storage

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced Complexity** - Removed ~200 lines of unused caching code
2. **Clear Purpose** - Remaining cache infrastructure has specific, well-defined uses
3. **Maintainability** - Simpler codebase is easier to understand and modify
4. **No Hidden Behavior** - No surprise caching of CRUD operations

## Next Steps

- Phase 4: Implement selective caching for truly static resources
- Phase 6: Final code cleanup and documentation updates
- Update environment variable documentation for cache configuration
