# Phase 1 Summary: Runner Binary and Infrastructure

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Runner Binary

- Built a Go-based runner executable that extracts and executes payloads
- Implemented support for bash, python, and node.js script execution
- Added comprehensive logging to stdout/stderr with structured format
- Implemented automatic cleanup of work directories on exit

### 2. Implemented Core Features

- **Payload Extraction**: Secure tar.gz extraction with path validation
- **Manifest Parsing**: YAML-based manifest with validation
- **Script Execution**: Support for multiple interpreters with environment variable injection
- **Signal Handling**: Graceful shutdown with cleanup on interrupt
- **Checksum Verification**: SHA256-based integrity checking (placeholder for full signing)

### 3. Set Up Build Pipeline

- Created Makefile with cross-compilation support
- Built binaries for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64
- Implemented local filesystem storage for artifacts
- Added build scripts for CI/CD integration

### 4. Defined Payload Structure

```yaml
# manifest.yaml format
version: v1
interpreter: bash|python|node
entrypoint: script.sh
environment:
  KEY: value
metadata:
  jobId: job-123
  eventId: event-456
  eventVersion: 1
  createdAt: 2025-08-05T07:00:00Z
```

## Key Files Created

1. **Runner Binary**: `apps/runner/cronium-runner/`
   - `cmd/runner/main.go` - CLI entry point
   - `internal/executor/` - Script execution logic
   - `internal/payload/` - Payload extraction and verification
   - `internal/manifest/` - Manifest parsing
   - `internal/logger/` - Structured logging

2. **Build System**:
   - `Makefile` - Build automation
   - `build.sh` - CI/CD build script
   - `artifacts/runners/` - Local artifact storage

## Testing

Successfully tested the runner with a sample payload:

- Created test payload with manifest and bash script
- Executed payload and verified output
- Confirmed environment variable injection
- Verified cleanup functionality

## Next Steps

Phase 2 will focus on:

1. Integrating payload generation with event save/update
2. Replacing the existing SSH executor with runner-based execution
3. Adding database tables for tracking payloads and runners

## Technical Notes

- Runner binary sizes: ~6.5-6.9 MB per platform
- No external dependencies (static binary)
- Placeholder signature verification ready for cosign integration
- All logging goes to stdout with structured format for easy parsing
