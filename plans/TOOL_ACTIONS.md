# Tool Actions Implementation Plan

## Objective

Complete the core Tool Actions functionality in Cronium without adding new features or unnecessary complexity.

## Current Status

- ✅ Core infrastructure implemented (plugin system, execution engine, templates)
- ✅ 8 tools integrated with 15 working actions
- ✅ UI components for management, configuration, and monitoring
- ❌ Variable system integration incomplete
- ❌ OAuth authentication not integrated
- ❌ Limited test coverage

## Core Tasks Checklist

### 1. Variable System Integration (Priority 1)

- [ ] Implement `getVariable` method in tool-action-executor.ts (line 219)
- [ ] Implement `setVariable` method in tool-action-executor.ts (line 224)
- [ ] Connect to Cronium's existing variable system from src/lib/variable-manager.ts
- [ ] Test variable access within tool actions
- [ ] Test variable persistence between workflow steps

### 2. Complete Credential UI Components (Priority 2)

- [ ] Fix webhook plugin credential form placeholder
- [ ] Add proper credential validation UI feedback
- [ ] Ensure all credential types have proper form components
- [ ] Test credential creation/update flow for each tool

### 3. OAuth Implementation (Priority 3)

- [ ] Connect existing OAuth components to tool system
- [ ] Implement OAuth2 refresh token logic
- [ ] Add OAuth support to Google Sheets tool
- [ ] Add OAuth support to Microsoft Teams tool
- [ ] Test OAuth flow end-to-end

### 4. Error Handling & Validation (Priority 4)

- [ ] Add input validation for all action parameters
- [ ] Improve error messages for common failure scenarios
- [ ] Ensure all actions have proper error categorization
- [ ] Test error recovery suggestions

### 5. Testing & Documentation (Priority 5)

- [ ] Write integration tests for tool-action-executor
- [ ] Add unit tests for each tool plugin
- [ ] Test retry strategies and circuit breaker
- [ ] Update documentation for each tool action
- [ ] Add example workflows using tool actions

### 6. Performance & Reliability (Priority 6)

- [ ] Implement connection pooling for HTTP-based tools
- [ ] Add request timeout handling
- [ ] Test rate limiting with real API limits
- [ ] Verify circuit breaker thresholds

## Excluded from Scope

- ❌ New tool integrations
- ❌ Visual workflow builder
- ❌ Batch operations
- ❌ Advanced quota management
- ❌ Action result caching
- ❌ Progress tracking UI
- ❌ Additional complex features

## Success Criteria

1. Tool actions can read and write Cronium variables
2. All existing tools have working credential management
3. OAuth tools can authenticate and refresh tokens
4. All actions handle errors gracefully
5. Core functionality has test coverage
6. Documentation is complete for implemented features

## Estimated Timeline

- Variable System: 2-3 hours
- Credential UI: 1-2 hours
- OAuth Integration: 3-4 hours
- Error Handling: 1-2 hours
- Testing & Docs: 2-3 hours

**Total: 9-14 hours of focused development**

## Next Steps

1. Start with variable system integration (highest impact)
2. Fix any blocking UI issues
3. Add OAuth only if time permits
4. Focus on stability over features
