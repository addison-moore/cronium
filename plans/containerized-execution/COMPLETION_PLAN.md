# Cronium Containerized Execution - Completion Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to review and ensure the complete functionality of the cronium-agent orchestrator service and its integration with the cronium-app backend. The goal
is to verify that all components are properly implemented and working together to support the full
feature set of Cronium.

## Review Scope

- Verify API endpoints completeness
- Identify and fix integration errors
- Ensure data compatibility and migration needs
- Validate execution capabilities for all event types
- Confirm runtime helper functionality

## Current State

- **Schema Status**: All new tables are defined in `src/shared/schema.ts`
- **Migration Questions**: 17 new tables need to be created (not renamed from existing tables)
- **Existing Data**: Test events, workflows, and logs that may need migration to new structure
- **Migration Scripts**: Multiple scripts exist for various migration tasks
