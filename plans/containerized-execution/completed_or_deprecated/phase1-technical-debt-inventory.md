# Phase 1: Technical Debt Inventory

## Overview

This document catalogs technical debt in the current Cronium execution system, categorized by severity and impact. Each item includes a description, current impact, and recommended remediation approach for the containerized migration.

## Critical Severity Issues

### 1. No Execution Isolation

**Location**: `src/lib/services/execution/local-script-executor.ts`
**Description**: Scripts execute directly on the host system with full access to the filesystem and network.
**Impact**:

- Security vulnerability - malicious scripts can compromise the host
- No resource isolation between executions
- Scripts can interfere with each other
- Access to application secrets and configuration

**Current Code Pattern**:

```typescript
const child = spawn(command, args, {
  env: { ...process.env, ...envVars },
  cwd: workingDirectory,
  shell: true,
});
```

**Remediation**: Replace with container-based execution using Docker API

### 2. Uncontrolled Resource Usage

**Location**: All executor modules
**Description**: No limits on CPU, memory, disk I/O, or network usage for script executions.
**Impact**:

- Single script can consume all system resources
- No protection against runaway processes
- System instability under load
- No fair resource allocation

**Remediation**: Implement Docker resource constraints and cgroups limits

### 3. Shared Runtime Environment

**Location**: `src/lib/services/execution/script-runner.ts`
**Description**: All scripts share the same Node.js process environment and temp directories.
**Impact**:

- Data leakage between executions
- Environment variable pollution
- Shared temp file conflicts
- No cleanup guarantees

**Remediation**: Isolated containers with separate filesystems and namespaces

## High Severity Issues

### 4. No Real-time Log Streaming

**Location**: `src/lib/services/execution/event-execution.service.ts`
**Description**: Logs are only available after execution completes, stored in database.
**Impact**:

- Poor user experience for long-running scripts
- No visibility into execution progress
- Difficult debugging of failed executions
- Large memory usage for log buffering

**Current Pattern**:

```typescript
// Logs collected after completion
const result = await executor.execute(script, options);
await this.saveExecutionLogs(executionId, result.logs);
```

**Remediation**: Implement WebSocket-based real-time log streaming

### 5. Poor Error Handling

**Location**: Multiple executor modules
**Description**: Inconsistent error handling, many unhandled edge cases, generic error messages.
**Impact**:

- Difficult troubleshooting
- Silent failures in some cases
- Inconsistent error reporting
- Poor recovery mechanisms

**Examples**:

- SSH connection failures not properly reported
- Script syntax errors show generic messages

**Description**: Server executions happen one at a time instead of in parallel.
**Impact**:

- Poor performance for multi-server events
- Unnecessary execution delays
- Timeout issues for many servers
- Poor resource utilization

**Current Code**:

```typescript
for (const server of servers) {
  const result = await this.executeOnSingleServer(event, server);
  results.push(result);
}
```

**Remediation**: Implement parallel execution with proper concurrency control

### 7. Missing Dependency Management

- No reproducible execution environment
- Security risks from uncontrolled packages

**Remediation**: Pre-built container images with controlled dependencies

## Medium Severity Issues

### 8. Inefficient SSH Connection Management

**Location**: `src/lib/services/execution/ssh-script-executor.ts`
**Description**: Connection pooling exists but has issues with connection reuse and cleanup.
**Impact**:

- Connection overhead for each execution
- Resource leaks from unclosed connections
- Poor performance for frequent executions
- Connection limit issues

**Remediation**: Implement proper connection pooling in Go orchestrator

### 9. Basic Workflow Data Passing

**Location**: `src/lib/services/execution/workflow-node-executor.ts`
**Description**: Data passing through JSON files with no validation or size limits.
**Impact**:

- Large data sets cause performance issues
- No data validation between nodes
- File system pollution
- Potential data corruption

**Current Pattern**:

```typescript
fs.writeFileSync(inputPath, JSON.stringify(inputData));
// Later...
const outputData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(outputPath, "utf-8"));
```

**Remediation**: Implement structured data passing with validation and limits

### 10. Limited Monitoring and Metrics

**Location**: Throughout execution system
**Description**: No structured metrics collection, limited monitoring capabilities.
**Impact**:

- No performance insights
- Difficult capacity planning
- No alerting on issues
- Limited debugging information

**Remediation**: Add comprehensive metrics and structured logging

### 11. Tight Coupling Between Components

**Location**: Various service files

**Impact**:

- Hard to unit test
- Difficult refactoring
- Complex dependency graph
- Brittle system

**Remediation**: Implement clean interfaces and dependency injection

### 12. No Execution Prioritization

**Location**: `src/lib/services/execution/event-execution.service.ts`
**Description**: All executions treated equally, no priority queue or scheduling.
**Impact**:

- Critical events can be delayed
- No fair scheduling
- Resource contention
- Poor user experience

**Remediation**: Implement priority-based job queue in orchestrator

## Low Severity Issues
