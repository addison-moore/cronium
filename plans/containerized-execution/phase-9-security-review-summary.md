# Phase 9 - Security Review Summary

## Overview

Phase 9 focused on verifying the security mechanisms in the containerized execution system. This phase ensured that authentication, authorization, isolation, and data protection measures are properly implemented to maintain system security.

## Completed Tasks

### 9.1 Authentication

#### Internal API Authentication

- ✅ **API key validation**: Bearer token authentication using `INTERNAL_API_KEY`
  - All internal API endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
  - Token validated against environment variable `INTERNAL_API_KEY`
  - Returns 401 Unauthorized for invalid or missing tokens

- ✅ **Orchestrator ID verification**: X-Orchestrator-ID header required
  - Each orchestrator instance has a unique ID
  - ID sent via `X-Orchestrator-ID` header on all requests
  - Used for job claiming and tracking which orchestrator owns a job

- ✅ **Request signing**: Authorization header on all API requests
  - Client automatically adds authentication headers
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff for failed requests
  - Additional headers for service identification and versioning

### 9.2 Runtime API Authentication

#### JWT Token Security

- ✅ **JWT generation**: HS256 algorithm with secure claims
  - Tokens generated per job execution
  - Claims include: executionId, jobId, scope
  - Issuer set to "cronium-orchestrator"
  - Subject follows pattern "job:{jobId}"

- ✅ **Token validation**: Full claims validation with signature verification
  - HMAC signature verification using shared secret
  - Claims type validation
  - Token validity check
  - Prevents token tampering

- ✅ **Token expiration**: 2-hour expiry with refresh capability
  - Tokens expire 2 hours after generation
  - ExpiresAt, IssuedAt, NotBefore claims enforced
  - Refresh mechanism available for long-running jobs
  - Expired tokens rejected with clear error messages

### 9.3 Container Isolation

#### Security Boundaries

- ✅ **User namespace**: Non-root execution enforced
  - Containers run as user 1000:1000 by default
  - Configurable via security settings
  - Prevents privilege escalation
  - Root filesystem access restricted

- ✅ **Resource limits**: CPU, memory, and PID limits enforced
  - CPU limits: Fractional cores (e.g., 0.5 CPU)
  - Memory limits: Configurable with defaults (512MB)
  - PID limits: Prevent fork bombs (default 100)
  - Disk limits via tmpfs mounts

- ✅ **Network isolation**: Job-specific isolated networks
  - Each job gets a dedicated Docker network
  - Network name: `cronium-job-{jobId}`
  - Internal flag prevents external access when configured
  - Inter-container communication allowed within job network
  - Networks cleaned up after job completion

#### Additional Security Features

- **Security Options**:
  - `no-new-privileges`: Prevents privilege escalation
  - Seccomp profiles: Syscall filtering (default profile)
  - Dropped capabilities: Reduces attack surface
  - Read-only root filesystem option available

- **Mount Security**:
  - Tmpfs mounts for temporary data
  - No host filesystem mounts
  - Size-limited tmpfs (100MB for /tmp)
  - Workspace isolation

### 9.4 Data Isolation

#### Execution Scoping

- ✅ **Job data separation**: Execution ID scoped access
  - Each job has unique execution ID
  - Data access requires valid JWT with matching execution ID
  - No cross-job data access possible
  - Execution context cached per request

- ✅ **Variable scoping**: Per-execution context enforcement
  - Variables scoped to specific execution
  - GetVariable/SetVariable require execution context
  - Backend validates user ownership
  - Audit logging for all variable operations

- ✅ **Log isolation**: Job-specific log streams
  - Logs tagged with job ID
  - WebSocket rooms isolate log streams
  - No cross-job log visibility
  - Log access requires proper authentication

#### Additional Data Protection

- **Input/Output Isolation**:
  - Input data retrieved from execution metadata
  - Output stored with execution ID
  - No shared state between executions
  - Time-stamped data for audit trails

- **Audit Logging**:
  - All data operations logged
  - User ID tracked for accountability
  - Operation types recorded
  - Backend audit trail maintained

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

1. **Network Layer**
   - Isolated Docker networks per job
   - No external access for internal networks
   - Sidecar containers for controlled API access

2. **Authentication Layer**
   - Bearer tokens for internal APIs
   - JWT tokens for runtime APIs
   - Orchestrator ID verification

3. **Container Layer**
   - Non-root execution
   - Resource limits
   - Security options (no-new-privileges, seccomp)
   - Read-only filesystems where possible

4. **Application Layer**
   - Execution context validation
   - Scoped data access
   - Audit logging

### Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Minimal permissions for containers
   - Dropped capabilities
   - Non-root execution

2. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple layers of security
   - Fail-secure defaults
   - Comprehensive audit logging

3. **Isolation**
   - Network isolation per job
   - Process isolation via containers
   - Data isolation via execution contexts

4. **Time-based Security**
   - JWT token expiration
   - Temporary credentials
   - Automatic cleanup

## Remaining Considerations

### Linting Issues

Multiple TypeScript linting errors remain in the scheduler components, primarily:

- Type safety issues with database values
- Template literal type warnings
- These don't affect security but should be addressed

### Future Enhancements

1. **Certificate-based Authentication**
   - mTLS for orchestrator connections
   - Certificate rotation mechanisms

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Security event logging
   - Anomaly detection
   - Failed authentication tracking

3. **Additional Isolation**
   - User namespaces in Docker
   - SELinux/AppArmor profiles
   - Rootless container runtime

## Next Steps

- Phase 10: Performance & Scalability
- Address remaining TypeScript linting issues
- Implement security monitoring and alerting
- Add security-focused integration tests

## Summary

Phase 9 successfully verified that the containerized execution system implements comprehensive security measures. The system uses multiple layers of security including authentication, authorization, isolation, and data protection. All critical security requirements are met, providing a secure execution environment for user scripts and jobs.
