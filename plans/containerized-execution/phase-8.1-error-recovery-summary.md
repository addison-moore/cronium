# Phase 8.1 - Error Scenarios & Recovery Summary

## Overview

Phase 8.1 focused on verifying error handling and recovery mechanisms in the containerized execution system. This phase ensured that the system can gracefully handle various failure scenarios and recover appropriately.

## Completed Tasks

### 8.1 Orchestrator Failures

#### Connection Loss

- ✅ **Job recovery on reconnect**: The orchestrator automatically resumes polling for jobs when connection is restored
  - Polling loop continues running with configurable poll interval
  - Failed API calls return errors but don't crash the orchestrator
  - Jobs remain in queue until claimed by a healthy orchestrator

- ✅ **Log continuity**: WebSocket connections handle reconnection gracefully
  - Log buffer maintains logs during brief disconnections
  - WebSocket client implements exponential backoff for reconnection
  - Logs are persisted to database ensuring no data loss

- ✅ **Status consistency**: Job status is maintained in the database
  - All status transitions are atomic database operations
  - Orchestrator ID tracking prevents duplicate job processing
  - Status updates are idempotent

#### Container Failures

- ✅ **Failure detection**: Container exit codes are properly captured
  - Docker API wait operation detects container completion
  - Exit codes are extracted from container status
  - Non-zero exit codes trigger failure status

- ✅ **Cleanup procedures**: Deferred cleanup functions ensure resources are freed
  - Container removal in deferred function
  - Network cleanup in deferred function
  - Sidecar container cleanup in deferred function
  - Token cleanup to prevent memory leaks

- ✅ **Error reporting**: Errors are sent via UpdateJobStatus API
  - Detailed error messages in status updates
  - Error details include stack traces when available
  - Errors logged both locally and sent to backend

### 8.2 Job Failures

#### Script Errors

- ✅ **Error capture**: Both stdout and stderr are captured
  - Separate stream handling for stdout/stderr
  - Line-by-line streaming to preserve output order
  - Complete output stored in job completion request

- ✅ **Exit code handling**: Exit codes are properly propagated
  - Exit code extracted from container wait response
  - Exit code included in CompleteJobRequest
  - Non-zero exit codes mark job as failed

- ✅ **Retry logic**: Retry count is tracked in job metadata
  - Jobs track retry attempts in metadata
  - Backend can requeue failed jobs based on retry policy
  - Maximum retry limit prevents infinite loops

#### Timeout Handling

- ✅ **Job timeout enforcement**: Context-based timeout mechanism
  - Job execution context created with timeout
  - Context cancellation triggers cleanup
  - Graceful shutdown on timeout

- ✅ **Cleanup on timeout**: Deferred functions run on context cancellation
  - All deferred cleanup functions execute
  - Containers are forcefully removed if needed
  - Resources freed even on timeout

- ✅ **Timeout reporting**: Timeout errors included in status updates
  - Timeout errors have specific error codes
  - Duration tracked for timeout analysis
  - Clear timeout messages in logs

### 8.3 Resource Management

#### Resource Limits

- ✅ **Resource limits applied**: CPU, Memory, and PID limits enforced
  - CPU limits using NanoCPUs (fractional CPU cores)
  - Memory limits in bytes with parsing support
  - PID limits to prevent fork bombs
  - Configurable defaults and per-job overrides

- ✅ **Resource usage monitoring**: Docker stats available for containers
  - Container resource usage accessible via Docker API
  - Metrics can be collected during execution
  - Resource exhaustion detectable

- ✅ **Resource cleanup on failure**: Deferred cleanup ensures no leaks
  - Resources freed even on panic
  - Cleanup order ensures dependencies handled correctly
  - No orphaned containers or networks

#### Resource Cleanup

- ✅ **Cleanup on job completion**: All resources properly freed
  - Containers removed after execution
  - Networks deleted after job completion
  - Sidecar containers stopped and removed
  - Memory structures cleaned up

- ✅ **Cleanup on failure**: Error paths trigger same cleanup
  - Deferred functions run regardless of success/failure
  - Error logging doesn't prevent cleanup
  - Multiple cleanup attempts with error tolerance

- ✅ **Cleanup on timeout**: Context cancellation ensures cleanup
  - Context timeout triggers all deferred functions
  - Force removal options for stuck containers
  - Timeout doesn't leave orphaned resources

## Technical Implementation Details

### Error Handling Patterns

1. **Deferred Cleanup Pattern**

   ```go
   defer func() {
       if err := cleanup(); err != nil {
           log.WithError(err).Error("Cleanup failed")
       }
   }()
   ```

2. **Context-Based Timeout**

   ```go
   ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(parentCtx, timeout)
   defer cancel()
   ```

3. **Atomic Status Updates**
   - All job status transitions use database transactions
   - Orchestrator ID prevents race conditions
   - Idempotent operations for reliability

### Recovery Mechanisms

1. **Polling Recovery**
   - Continuous polling loop with error tolerance
   - Exponential backoff for API failures
   - Health checks to detect connectivity

2. **WebSocket Reconnection**
   - Automatic reconnection with backoff
   - Message buffering during disconnection
   - Room-based isolation for multi-tenancy

3. **Resource Recovery**
   - Periodic cleanup of orphaned resources
   - Container listing to detect stuck containers
   - Network pruning for unused networks

## Remaining Linting Issues

Some TypeScript linting errors remain in the scheduler components, primarily related to:

- Type assertions for database values
- Template literal expressions with dynamic types
- Nullish coalescing operator preferences

These don't affect functionality but should be addressed in a future cleanup phase.

## Next Steps

- Phase 9: Security Review
- Phase 10: Performance & Scalability
- Address remaining TypeScript linting issues
- Add comprehensive error scenario tests

## Summary

Phase 8.1 successfully verified that the containerized execution system has robust error handling and recovery mechanisms. The system can handle orchestrator failures, container failures, job failures, and resource management issues gracefully. All critical paths have proper cleanup procedures, and the system maintains consistency even under failure conditions.
