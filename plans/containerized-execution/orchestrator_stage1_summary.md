# Cronium Orchestrator Phase 1 Summary

## âœ… Summary of Changes in the Updated Plan (Phase 1)

### 1. Orchestrator Bundled with Backend

- The Go-based orchestrator is now **packaged together** with the Next.js backend in a **single container**, simplifying deployment.

### 2. Focus on Local Execution and SSH

- Remote agent support is **deferred to Phase 2**.
- Phase 1 execution includes:
  - **Local containerized execution** using Docker
  - **SSH-based remote execution**, refactored from the existing backend implementation

### 3. Modular Project Structure

- Clearly separated code modules for:
  - Configuration
  - API communication
  - Container execution
  - SSH execution
  - Logging and utilities
- Interface-based design (`Executor`) for easy extension in Phase 2

### 4. Job Lifecycle Definition

- Step-by-step definition of how each job is processed and reported
- Emphasis on log streaming and API integration

### 5. Placeholder for Remote Execution Logic

- The architecture explicitly leaves room for future remote agent support (via a `remote` package)

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits of This Approach

| Change                          | Benefit                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single-container deployment** | âœ… Easier for early adopters to set up and test locally        |
| **Simplified architecture**     | âœ… Faster development cycle and less risk during early stages  |
| **Deferred complexity**         | âœ… Avoids premature optimization and distributed system design |
| **Modular design**              | âœ… Lays groundwork for clean scaling in Phase 2                |
| **Preserved flexibility**       | âœ… Room for evolving execution strategies and job routing      |
