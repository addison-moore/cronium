# Phase 3.1 Event → Job Conversion - Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Script Events ✅

- **Script content properly packaged**: Content stored in `payload.script.content`
- **Environment variables included**: Converted from array to object in `payload.environment`
- **Runtime selection**: Based on EventType (BASH, NODEJS, PYTHON)
- **Container images**: Automatically assigned (e.g., `cronium/bash:latest`)
- **Working directory**: Handled by container runtime

### 2. HTTP Request Events ✅

- **Request configuration**: Complete HTTP details in `payload.httpRequest`
  - Method (GET, POST, etc.)
  - URL (full endpoint)
  - Headers (as key-value object)
  - Body (string content)
- **Container image**: `cronium/http-client:latest`
- **Authentication**: Preserved in headers

### 3. Tool Action Events ✅

- **Tool configuration**: Stored in `payload.toolAction`
  - Tool type (slack, discord, email, etc.)
  - Config object with all parameters
- **Container image**: `cronium/tool-executor:latest`
- **Authentication tokens**: Included in config

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Created Job Payload Builder

- Centralized payload construction in `job-payload-builder.ts`
- Consistent structure across all event types
- Type-safe payload generation
- Handles all event-specific details

### 2. Enhanced Job Service Interface

- Updated `CreateJobInput` to support all event types
- Added fields for HTTP requests and tool actions
- Included timeout and retry configuration
- Preserved all event metadata

### 3. Updated Job Creation Flow

- Scheduler uses payload builder for all events
- Events router uses the same builder
- Workflows use the builder via scheduler
- Consistent job creation across the system

## Job Payload Structure

```typescript
interface JobPayload {
  executionLogId: number;
  input: Record<string, unknown>;

  // Type-specific fields
  script?: {
    type: string;
    content: string;
  };
  httpRequest?: {
    method: string;
    url: string;
    headers?: Record<string, string>;
    body?: string;
  };
  toolAction?: {
    toolType: string;
    config: Record<string, unknown>;
  };

  // Common fields
  environment?: Record<string, string>;
  target?: {
    serverId?: number;
    containerImage?: string;
  };
  timeout?: {
    value: number;
    unit: string;
  };
  retries?: number;
}
```

## Validation

Created `test-job-creation.ts` to validate:

- Script events with environment variables
- HTTP requests with full configuration
- Tool actions with parameters
- Remote execution targeting
- Input data passing

## Next Steps

The job creation system is now fully equipped to handle all event types with proper payload structures. The orchestrator can use these payloads to:

1. Execute scripts in appropriate containers
2. Make HTTP requests with full configuration
3. Execute tool actions with proper parameters
4. Handle remote execution via SSH

Phase 3.1 is complete. All event types are properly converted to jobs with comprehensive payloads.
