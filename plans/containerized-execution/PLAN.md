# Cronium Containerized Architecture Transition Plan

## Overview

This comprehensive plan outlines the complete transition from Cronium's current file-based execution system to a modern, containerized architecture with API-based runtime communication. Since Cronium is in early development with no production users, we have the unique opportunity to implement breaking changes that will significantly improve security, reliability, and maintainability.

## Risk Management

### High Priority Risks

1. **API Latency Impact**
   - **Mitigation**: Aggressive caching, connection pooling
   - **Monitoring**: Latency metrics on all endpoints
   - **Fallback**: Increase timeout limits temporarily

2. **Migration Failures**
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive validation suite
   - **Monitoring**: Migration progress tracking
   - **Fallback**: Manual intervention procedures

3. **Container Resource Usage**
   - **Mitigation**: Strict resource limits
   - **Monitoring**: Resource usage metrics
   - **Fallback**: Horizontal scaling capability

### Medium Priority Risks

1. **Network Connectivity Issues**
   - **Mitigation**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - **Monitoring**: Connection failure metrics
   - **Fallback**: Queue for retry

2. **Token Security**
   - **Mitigation**: Short-lived tokens, rotation
   - **Monitoring**: Auth failure tracking
   - **Fallback**: Token revocation capability

## Local Development Setup

The application is now ready for local development with the following components:

### Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure Docker, pnpm, and Node.js are installed
2. **Run Setup Script**: Execute `./scripts/setup-dev.sh` to:
   - Create `.env.local` with default configuration
   - Install dependencies
   - Start infrastructure services (PostgreSQL, Valkey)
   - Run database migrations
   - Build Runtime API and Orchestrator services
   - Build Docker images
   - Optionally seed the database

3. **Start Services**:

   ```bash
   # Start all infrastructure services
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.stack.yml up -d

   # Start Next.js development server
   pnpm dev

   # Start WebSocket server (in another terminal)
   pnpm dev:socket
   ```

4. **Access Points**:
   - Main App: http://localhost:5001
   - Jobs Dashboard: http://localhost:5001/dashboard/jobs
   - WebSocket: ws://localhost:5002
   - Runtime API: http://localhost:8081
   - Database: postgresql://localhost:5432/cronium

### Key UI Components

- **Jobs Management**: Full UI for viewing and managing job execution
  - `/dashboard/jobs` - List all jobs with filters
  - `/dashboard/jobs/[id]` - View job details and real-time logs
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time log streaming for job execution
- **Job Status Tracking**: Visual indicators for job states

### Development Commands

```bash
# Database operations
pnpm db:push          # Push schema changes
pnpm db:studio        # Open Drizzle Studio
pnpm db:generate      # Generate migrations

# Testing
pnpm test             # Run all tests
pnpm test:unit        # Run unit tests only
pnpm test:integration # Run integration tests

# Code quality
pnpm lint             # Run linter
pnpm format           # Format code

# Migration
pnpm migrate:events   # Migrate events to API-based helpers
pnpm migrate:test     # Test migration with dry-run
```

## Conclusion

This plan represents a complete transformation of Cronium's execution architecture. By leveraging our position as an early-stage project, we can implement a clean, secure, and modern system without the burden of backward compatibility. The API-based runtime system will provide:

1. **Enhanced Security**: No file system access, proper isolation
2. **Better Performance**: Caching, optimized communication
3. **Modern Features**: Streaming, tool actions, type safety
4. **Simplified Maintenance**: Single implementation path
5. **Future Scalability**: Ready for distributed execution

The temporary disruption to test data is a small price to pay for building a solid foundation that will serve Cronium well as it grows.
