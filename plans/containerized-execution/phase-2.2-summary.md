# Phase 2.2 Data Migration Requirements - Summary

## Completed Analysis

### 1. Existing Events ✅

- **Already using job-based execution**: The scheduler creates jobs via `jobService.createJob()`
- **Payload structure is correct**: Jobs include script content, environment variables, and metadata
- **Environment variables format**: Stored as key-value pairs in `envVars` table, converted to object in job payload
- **Runtime helpers are compatible**:
  - All helpers (JS, Python, Bash) read from `input.json` and `event.json`
  - Output is written to `output.json`
  - Condition handling via `condition.json`
  - Compatible with container file-based I/O

### 2. Existing Workflows ✅

- **Workflow execution uses job system**: Calls `scheduler.executeEvent()` which creates jobs
- **Step format is compatible**: WorkflowNodes contain eventId references
- **Conditional logic works**: ConnectionType (ON_SUCCESS, ON_FAILURE, ON_CONDITION, ALWAYS) properly handled
- **Input/output passing**: Implemented via `resolvedInputData` parameter to `executeEvent`

### 3. Server Configurations ✅

- **SSH credentials properly stored**:
  - `sshKey` field contains encrypted private key
  - `username`, `address`, and `port` fields for connection
  - Encryption handled by `encryptionService`
- **Metadata compatible**: All required fields present for remote execution

## Key Findings

1. **System is already job-ready**: The current implementation already creates jobs for all executions
2. **No data migration needed**: All existing data structures are compatible
3. **Runtime helpers are container-ready**: File-based I/O model works in containers
4. **Workflow system integrated**: Uses the job queue via scheduler

## Migration Scripts Created

1. **`migrate-to-job-system.ts`**:
   - Checks and fixes any missing required fields
   - Creates performance indexes
   - Reports migration status

2. **`verify-job-compatibility.ts`**:
   - Comprehensive compatibility check
   - Reports any data issues
   - Provides detailed compatibility report

## Recommendations

1. Run the verification script to ensure data integrity:

   ```bash
   tsx src/scripts/migrations/verify-job-compatibility.ts
   ```

2. Apply performance indexes if not already present:

   ```bash
   docker exec cronium-app-dev npx drizzle-kit push
   ```

3. The system is ready for containerized execution without data migration!

Phase 2.2 is now complete. The data model is fully compatible with the job-based execution system.
