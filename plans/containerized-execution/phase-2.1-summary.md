# Phase 2.1 Database Schema Verification - Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Jobs Table Verification ✅

- **All required columns exist**: id, eventId, userId, type, status, priority, payload, scheduledFor, orchestratorId, startedAt, completedAt, result, attempts, lastError, metadata, createdAt, updatedAt
- **Foreign key constraints**: Properly references events.id and users.id
- **Enum types defined**:
  - JobStatus: QUEUED, CLAIMED, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELLED
  - JobType: SCRIPT, HTTP_REQUEST, TOOL_ACTION
  - JobPriority: LOW (0), NORMAL (1), HIGH (2), CRITICAL (3)
- **Type exports available**: `Job` and `InsertJob` types are properly exported

### 2. Events Table Verification ✅

- **Compatible with job creation**: All necessary fields present
- **Event types supported**: BASH, NODEJS, PYTHON, SCHEDULED, WEBHOOK, HTTP
- **Has all fields needed by orchestrator**: content, type, status, httpMethod, httpUrl, httpHeaders, httpBody, toolActionConfig, runLocation, serverId, timeoutValue, retries

### 3. Logs Table Verification ✅

- **job_id column exists**: Present as `jobId` with proper foreign key reference to jobs.id
- **Proper structure for job-based logging**: Includes eventId, workflowId, jobId, status, output, error, startTime, endTime, duration, userId

### 4. Performance Indexes Created ✅

Created migration file `src/db/migrations/add-job-indexes.sql` with:

- **Jobs table indexes**:
  - idx_jobs_status_scheduled_for: For polling pending jobs
  - idx_jobs_user_id_status: For user's job queries
  - idx_jobs_event_id: For event-based queries
  - idx_jobs_orchestrator_id: For orchestrator-specific queries
  - idx_jobs_queue_poll: Composite index for efficient queue polling with priority
- **Logs table indexes**:
  - idx_logs_job_id: For job-based log queries
  - idx_logs_event_id: For event-based log queries
  - idx_logs_user_id: For user's log queries
  - idx_logs_job_id_start_time: Composite index for log filtering

## Key Findings

1. **Schema is well-structured** for the job-based execution model
2. **All necessary columns and relationships** are in place
3. **Performance indexes** have been added to optimize common queries
4. **Type safety** is maintained with proper TypeScript types and enums

## Next Steps

To apply the performance indexes, run:

```bash
docker exec cronium-app-dev npx drizzle-kit push
```

Phase 2.1 is now complete. The database schema is verified and optimized for the containerized execution architecture.
