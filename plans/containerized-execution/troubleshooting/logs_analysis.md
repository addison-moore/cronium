# Docker Compose Logs Analysis - Latest Update

## Overview

This analysis examines the latest Docker logs after implementing the job type transformation fix. The system shows significant progress - jobs are now being successfully claimed and acknowledged by the orchestrator. However, execution fails due to a missing Docker image.

## Service Status

### Services Running Successfully:

1. **cronium-valkey-dev** - Redis-compatible cache (healthy, processing health check pings)
2. **cronium-app-dev** - Main Next.js application (running on port 5001)
3. **cronium-agent-dev** - Orchestrator service (polling and claiming jobs successfully)

### Current State:

- The job queue system is functioning (200 OK responses)
- Jobs are being created and queued successfully
- Jobs are being claimed by the orchestrator ("Received jobs from queue count=1")
- Job acknowledgment is working properly
- Execution fails at runtime sidecar creation

## Identified Issues

### 1. Missing Docker Image (CRITICAL - Blocks Execution)

**Error Pattern:**

```
failed to create runtime sidecar: Error response from daemon: No such image: cronium/runtime-api:latest
```

**Impact:**

- Jobs cannot execute because the required runtime sidecar image is not available
- The orchestrator successfully claims jobs but fails immediately when trying to create the execution environment

**Root Cause:**

- The Docker image `cronium/runtime-api:latest` has not been built or pulled
- This image is required for the runtime sidecar that provides the execution environment for jobs

**Solution:**

- Build the runtime-api Docker image from the runtime/runtime-api directory
- Ensure the image is tagged as `cronium/runtime-api:latest`
- The image should be available locally or in a registry accessible to the orchestrator

### 2. WebSocket Connection Timeouts (Non-Critical)

**Error Pattern:**

```
Failed to reconnect WebSocket error="failed to connect to WebSocket: read tcp 172.18.0.3:xxxxx->172.18.0.4:5001: i/o timeout"
```

**Frequency:** Occurs intermittently

**Impact:**

- Log streaming may be affected
- Real-time updates might be delayed
- Job execution is NOT affected (uses HTTP polling)

**Root Cause:**

- WebSocket connection attempts timing out after 10 seconds
- Likely due to Socket.IO configuration or network settings
- The orchestrator continues to function normally using HTTP

### 2. Invalid Tool Credentials (Minor)

**Error Pattern:**

```
Invalid credentials format for tool 4
Invalid credentials format for tool 3
Invalid credentials format for tool 1
```

**Impact:**

- Tool integrations (Slack, Discord, Email) may not work
- Does not affect core job execution functionality

**Root Cause:**

- Tools have missing or improperly formatted credentials
- Encryption/decryption service may be expecting different format

### 3. Initial Service Connection Issues (Resolved)

**Error Pattern:**

```
dial tcp: lookup cronium-app-dev on 127.0.0.11:53: no such host
```

**Status:** Resolved - This only occurs during initial startup before all services are ready. Once the Next.js app is fully started, connections work properly.

### 4. Next.js Dynamic API Warnings (Development)

**Warning:**

```
Route "/api/internal/jobs/[jobId]/acknowledge" used `params.jobId`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties.
```

**Impact:**

- Development-only warning
- No functional impact
- Should be fixed for Next.js 15 compatibility

### 5. Repetitive Initialization Messages

**Pattern:**

```
Credential encryption initialized
Creating new global scheduler instance
```

**Impact:**

- Indicates services are being recreated on each request
- May cause performance issues
- Could lead to memory leaks over time

## System Performance

### Positive Indicators:

- API response times are good (50-100ms average)
- Job polling is consistent (every 5 seconds)
- Health checks passing regularly
- Jobs are being successfully created, queued, and claimed
- Job acknowledgment system is working properly

### Major Progress:

- **Job Type Issue RESOLVED**: The transformation layer successfully converts SCRIPT jobs to container/ssh format
- Jobs are now being claimed by the orchestrator (job_PR79T7LFeynw successfully acknowledged)
- The job execution flow progresses to the runtime sidecar creation stage

## Recommendations

### Critical - Must Fix Immediately:

1. **Build Runtime API Docker Image**

   ```bash
   # Navigate to runtime-api directory
   cd runtime/runtime-api

   # Build the Docker image
   docker build -t cronium/runtime-api:latest .

   # Verify image exists
   docker images | grep cronium/runtime-api
   ```

### Medium Priority:

1. **Configure WebSocket Properly**
   - WebSocket issues don't block job execution (HTTP polling works)
   - But should be fixed for real-time log streaming

2. **Update Next.js API Routes**
   - Add `await` for params in dynamic routes
   - Follow Next.js 15 best practices

3. **Singleton Services**
   - Credential encryption and scheduler are being recreated
   - Should implement proper singleton pattern

## Debugging Steps

To verify the fix is working:

```bash
# Check that jobs are being claimed
docker logs cronium-agent-dev | grep "Received jobs"

# Check job status updates
docker logs cronium-agent-dev | grep "Starting job execution"

# Check for the missing image error
docker logs cronium-agent-dev | grep "No such image"
```

To build and verify the runtime image:

```bash
# Check if Dockerfile exists
ls -la runtime/runtime-api/Dockerfile

# Build the image
cd runtime/runtime-api && docker build -t cronium/runtime-api:latest .

# List Docker images
docker images | grep cronium
```

## Summary

**Major Success**: The job type transformation fix is working! Jobs are now:

1. Created successfully in the database
2. Transformed from SCRIPT to container format
3. Claimed by the orchestrator
4. Acknowledged and ready for execution

**Single Remaining Blocker**: The Docker image `cronium/runtime-api:latest` is missing. Once this image is built, job execution should proceed successfully.

Priority actions:

1. Build the runtime-api Docker image (CRITICAL - blocks all execution)
2. Test end-to-end job execution after image is available
3. Fix WebSocket for real-time log streaming (non-critical)
