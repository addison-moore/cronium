# Tool Action Events - Phase 2 Implementation Plan (Revised)

**STATUS: 🚧 IN PROGRESS**  
**LAST UPDATED: 2025-07-07**

## 🚨 URGENT: Primary Focus Has Changed

**See [IMMEDIATE_PRIORITIES.md](./IMMEDIATE_PRIORITIES.md) for critical path items**

The immediate priority is making Tool Actions work as a fully functional event type that can be:

- Created and configured in the event form
- Scheduled with cron or interval triggers
- Executed by the scheduler
- Incorporated into workflows
- Properly managed through a tools UI

## 🎯 Revised Vision

Focus on building a **functional, reliable, and integrated** tool action system:

- **Functional**: Tool actions work as first-class events
- **Reliable**: Proper execution, error handling, and logging
- **Integrated**: Full support in workflows and scheduling
- **User-friendly**: Clear UI for configuration and management

## ✅ Completed in Phase 2

### Core Integrations

- ✅ Slack integration (4 actions)
- ✅ Discord integration (4 actions)
- ✅ Microsoft Teams integration (4 actions)
- ✅ Google Sheets integration (5 actions)
- ✅ Notion integration (4 actions)
- ✅ Trello integration (5 actions)

### Infrastructure

- ✅ OAuth2 authentication system
- ✅ Visual Action Builder (drag-and-drop workflow creation)
- ✅ Webhook Management System
- ✅ Rate Limiting & Quotas System

## 📋 Remaining Focus Areas (Reprioritized)

### 1. Core Functionality (IMMEDIATE - Week 1)

#### Enable Tool Actions as Events

- **Feature Flag Removal**: Make TOOL_ACTION available to all users
- **Form Integration**: Ensure ToolActionSection works properly
- **Scheduler Integration**: Execute tool actions on schedule
- **Workflow Support**: Use tool actions in workflows

#### Basic Execution

- **Credential Loading**: Retrieve tool credentials at runtime
- **Parameter Validation**: Validate inputs before execution
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and logging
- **Variable Support**: Runtime variable replacement

### 2. Tools Management UI (Priority 1 - Week 2)

**Hybrid Approach** (See [Tools-Management.md](./Tools-Management.md)):

#### Enhance Settings > Tools Tab

- **Health Indicators**: Connection status per credential
- **Test Connection**: Verify credentials button
- **Action Count**: Show available actions per tool
- **Quick Links**: "Create Event with Tool" shortcuts

#### New Tools Dashboard (`/dashboard/tools`)

- **Tools Overview**: Grid view with health status
- **Action Browser**: Search/filter all actions
- **Execution History**: Recent tool action runs
- **Quick Actions**: Favorites and one-click testing

### 3. Reliability & Error Handling (Priority 2)

#### User-Friendly Errors

- **Plain English**: No technical jargon in error messages
- **Actionable**: Clear steps to resolve issues
- **Context**: Show what went wrong and why

#### Resilience Features

- **Auto-Retry**: Smart retry with backoff
- **Fallbacks**: Alternative actions when primary fails
- **Recovery**: Graceful degradation

### 4. Modularity & Extensibility (Priority 3)

#### Clean Plugin Architecture

- **Standardized Interface**: Consistent plugin structure
- **Plugin SDK**: Tools for building new integrations
- **Validation**: Automated plugin testing
- **Versioning**: Manage plugin updates safely

#### Action Composition

- **Templates**: Pre-built action workflows
- **Visual Builder**: Improved drag-and-drop interface
- **Data Flow**: Clear visualization of data movement
- **Debugging**: Step-through execution

### 5. Core Improvements (Priority 4)

#### Batch Operations

- **Simple UI**: Process multiple items easily
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates
- **Error Handling**: Continue on partial failures
- **Results View**: Clear summary of outcomes

#### Data Transformation

- **Visual Mapper**: Drag-and-drop field mapping
- **Presets**: Common transformation patterns
- **Preview**: See results before execution
- **Validation**: Ensure data integrity

- ❌ Third-party publishing platform

## 💡 Design Principles

1. **Simplicity First**
   - Every feature must be self-explanatory
   - Progressive disclosure of complexity
   - Sensible defaults everywhere

2. **Reliability Always**
   - Fail gracefully with helpful messages
   - Never lose user data
   - Always provide a way forward

3. **Consistency Matters**
   - Same patterns across all tools
   - Predictable behavior
   - Unified visual language

4. **Speed is Feature**
   - Instant feedback
   - Optimistic updates
   - Background processing

## 📝 Technical Guidelines
