# Tool Action Events - High-Level Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the phased approach to implementing Tool Actions as a first-class event type in Cronium. The implementation will be divided into four distinct phases, each building upon the previous phase's foundation while maintaining system stability and backward compatibility.

> **Note**: This plan has been updated based on analysis of industry leaders Zapier and n8n. See [RECOMMENDATIONS.md](./RECOMMENDATIONS.md) for detailed findings and rationale behind these enhancements.

- **Integration Development**: Individual tool plugins and actions
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests

### Risk Mitigation

- **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to control rollout
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality is preserved
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build features incrementally
- **Rollback Strategy**: Maintain ability to rollback changes

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Enhanced Plugin System

```typescript
interface ToolAction {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  actionType: "create" | "update" | "search" | "delete"; // Zapier-inspired classification

  // Development mode support
  developmentMode: "visual" | "code";

  // Schemas
  inputSchema: z.ZodSchema<any>;
  outputSchema: z.ZodSchema<any>;

  // Execution with enhanced context
  execute: (
    credentials: any,
    params: any,
    context: ExecutionContext,
  ) => Promise<any>;

  // Testing and validation
  testData?: TestDataGenerator;
  validate?: (params: any) => ValidationResult;

  // Real-time features
  supportsWebhook?: boolean;
  webhookConfig?: WebhookConfig;

  // Transformations
  supportsTransformations?: boolean;
  defaultTransformations?: Transformation[];
}

interface ToolPlugin {
  // ... existing properties
  actions: ToolAction[];
  getActionById: (id: string) => ToolAction | undefined;
}

interface ExecutionContext {
  // Runtime helpers
  variables: VariableManager;
  logger: Logger;

  // Real-time feedback (n8n-inspired)
  onProgress?: (progress: Progress) => void;
  onPartialResult?: (result: any) => void;

  // Testing mode
  isTest?: boolean;
  mockData?: any;
}
```

#### 2. Event System Extension

```typescript
// Enhanced EventType enum
export enum EventType {
  NODEJS = "NODEJS",
  PYTHON = "PYTHON",
  BASH = "BASH",
  HTTP_REQUEST = "HTTP_REQUEST",
  TOOL_ACTION = "TOOL_ACTION", // New
}

// Tool action configuration
interface ToolActionConfig {
  toolType: string;
  actionType: string;
  toolId: number;
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
  outputMapping?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

#### 3. Database Schema Extensions

```sql
-- Extend events table
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN tool_action_config JSONB;

-- Tool action execution logs
CREATE TABLE tool_action_logs (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  event_id INTEGER REFERENCES events(id),
  tool_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  action_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  parameters JSONB,
  result JSONB,
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
