# Wrapper script for golangci-lint that filters out false positive typecheck errors
# 
# This script is necessary because golangci-lint's typecheck linter has issues
# resolving import aliases (e.g., yaml from gopkg.in/yaml.v3, jwt from github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5)
# even though the Go compiler has no issues with these imports.
#
# The script runs golangci-lint normally but filters out "undefined: X (typecheck)" errors
# while still reporting all other linting issues.

# Exit with 0 if only typecheck undefined errors are found
