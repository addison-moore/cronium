## Introduction

Tool Actions in Cronium allow you to integrate with external services like Slack, Discord, Email, and more. Instead of writing scripts, you can use pre-built actions to send messages, create tasks, update spreadsheets, and perform other operations.

### Using in Workflows

Tool actions can be part of multi-step workflows:

1. Create a workflow
2. Add a tool action step
3. Use output from previous steps as input
4. Chain multiple tool actions together

### Conditional Execution

Set up tool actions to run based on conditions:

- On success of another event
- On failure for notifications
- Based on data values

### Batch Operations

Some tools support batch operations:

- Send multiple messages
- Update multiple records
- Process lists of items

### Error Handling

- **Automatic Retries**: Failed actions retry with exponential backoff
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures
- **Error Notifications**: Get alerted on failures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Tool not found" Error

- Ensure the tool is created and active
- Check that you have access to the tool
- Verify the tool hasn't been deleted

#### "Invalid credentials" Error

- Re-enter your credentials
- Generate new tokens/webhooks if needed
- Check for expired API keys

#### "Rate limit exceeded" Error

- Wait before retrying
- Check your service's rate limits
- Consider upgrading your plan

#### Messages Not Appearing

- Verify webhook URL is correct
- Check channel/recipient permissions
- Look for service-specific requirements

### Debugging Steps

1. Check **Execution History** for error details
2. Use **Test Connection** to verify credentials
3. Review action parameters for typos
4. Check service documentation for requirements

## Best Practices

### Security

- **Rotate credentials regularly**: Update webhooks/API keys periodically
- **Use least privilege**: Only grant necessary permissions
- **Monitor access**: Review audit logs regularly
- **Secure channels**: Use private channels for sensitive data

### Performance

- **Batch when possible**: Group similar operations
- **Set appropriate timeouts**: Don't wait too long for responses
- **Monitor execution times**: Identify slow operations
- **Use caching**: For read-heavy operations

### Organization

- **Naming conventions**: Use descriptive names for tools and events
- **Tag events**: Make them easy to find and filter
- **Document purpose**: Add descriptions to events
- **Group by function**: Organize tools by team or purpose

### Monitoring

- **Regular health checks**: Review Tools Dashboard daily
- **Set up alerts**: Get notified of failures
- **Track metrics**: Monitor success rates and performance
- **Review logs**: Check for patterns in errors
