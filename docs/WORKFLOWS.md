# 🔄 Cronium Workflows: Orchestrating Complex Automations

## Overview

Workflows in Cronium represent the evolution of automation from isolated tasks to interconnected, intelligent processes. A Workflow is a visual, directed acyclic graph (DAG) that chains multiple Events together, creating sophisticated automation pipelines with conditional logic, data flow, and orchestration capabilities.

While Events are the atoms of automation, Workflows are the molecules—combining simple building blocks into complex, powerful structures. Through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface powered by React Flow, users can design, visualize, and manage multi-step automations that respond dynamically to various triggers and conditions.

## Current Implementation

### Core Concepts

#### 🎯 Workflow Structure

- **Nodes**: Individual Events that perform specific tasks
- **Edges**: Connections defining execution flow and data passing
- **DAG Architecture**: Ensures no circular dependencies
- **Visual Canvas**: Interactive design environment

#### 🚀 Trigger Types

1. **Manual Trigger** 👆
   - Start workflows on-demand
   - Perfect for testing and ad-hoc tasks
   - One-click execution from dashboard

2. **Scheduled Trigger** ⏰

   - Cron expressions or interval scheduling
   - Timezone-aware execution

3. **Webhook Trigger** 🔗
   - External service integration
   - Real-time event response
   - Secure payload handling

#### 🔀 Connection Types

Workflows support intelligent routing between Events:

- **ON_SUCCESS**: Proceed when previous event succeeds
- **ON_FAILURE**: Handle error conditions gracefully
- **ALWAYS**: Execute regardless of outcome
- **ON_CONDITION**: Custom logic based on output

## Advanced Features

### 🔄 Data Flow Management

Workflows provide sophisticated data passing between nodes:

```javascript

const customers = await db.query("SELECT * FROM customers WHERE ...");
await cronium.output({
  customerCount: customers.length,
  customerIds: customers.map((c) => c.id),
});

// Node 2: Process each customer
const input = await cronium.input();
const results = [];
for (const id of input.customerIds) {
  // Process customer
  results.push(processedData);
}
await cronium.output({ processedCustomers: results });

// Node 3: Generate report
const input = await cronium.input();
const report = generateReport(input.processedCustomers);
```

### 🎭 Dynamic Execution Paths

Workflows support conditional execution based on runtime data:

- **Output-based Routing**: Route based on previous node output
- **Error Handling Paths**: Different flows for different error types

## Current Limitations & Workarounds

### 1. No Merge Operations

**Limitation**: Nodes cannot have multiple input connections
**Workaround**: Use shared variables or external storage for data aggregation

### 2. Linear Data Flow

**Limitation**: Data flows forward only (no loops)
**Workaround**: Use conditional actions or scheduled re-runs for iterative processes

### 3. Limited Parallelism

**Limitation**: Parallel branches must remain independent
**Workaround**: Use external queuing systems for complex parallel patterns
