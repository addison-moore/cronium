# üîß Cronium Tools: Integrations & Automation

## Overview

Cronium Tools is a powerful integration platform that transforms how you connect services and automate workflows. By introducing Tool Actions as a first-class event type alongside traditional scripts (Bash, Python, Node.js) and HTTP requests, Cronium enables you to build sophisticated automations without writing complex code.

Think of Tools as pre-built, intelligent connectors that understand how to interact with popular services like Slack, Google Sheets, Trello, and hundreds more. Each tool provides a set of actions you can execute as part of your workflows, from sending messages to creating tasks, updating databases, or triggering complex operations.

## Core Concepts & Terminology

### Understanding the Terminology

To avoid confusion, let's clarify the key terms used in the Cronium Tools system:

- **Tool** - A type of integration service (e.g., Slack, Discord, Email, Google Sheets). These are the actual external services you want to connect to.

- **Tool Credential** - A saved authentication configuration for a specific tool, stored in the `tool_credentials` table. For example, you might have multiple Slack credentials for different workspaces.

- **Tool Action** - A specific operation that can be performed with a tool (e.g., "Send Message", "Create Channel", "Update Spreadsheet"). Each tool provides multiple actions.

- **Tool Action Event** - An event in Cronium that executes a tool action. This is one of the four event types alongside Script, HTTP Request, and Workflow.

- **Tool Type** - The identifier for a tool in the system (e.g., "SLACK", "EMAIL", "DISCORD"). This is used internally to match credentials with their corresponding tool plugin.

- **Tool Category** - A grouping of related tools (e.g., "communication" for Slack/Discord/Email, "productivity" for Trello/Notion).

### What are Tools?

Tools are modular plugins that provide structured access to external services. Each tool:

- **Encapsulates authentication** - Securely stores and manages API credentials
- **Provides typed actions** - Well-defined operations with validated inputs/outputs
- **Handles complexity** - Abstracts away API intricacies, rate limiting, and error handling
- **Enables composition** - Actions can be chained together to create powerful workflows

### Example: Understanding the Terminology

Let's use Slack as an example to illustrate these concepts:

- **Tool**: Slack (the messaging platform)
- **Tool Type**: "SLACK" (internal identifier)
- **Tool Category**: "communication"
- **Tool Credentials**: Your saved Slack workspace tokens (e.g., "Marketing Team Slack", "Engineering Slack")
- **Tool Actions**:
  - "Send Message" - Posts a message to a channel
  - "Create Channel" - Creates a new Slack channel
  - "Add Reaction" - Adds an emoji reaction to a message
  - "Find User" - Searches for a user by email or name
- **Tool Action Event**: A Cronium event configured to execute "Send Message" action every morning at 9 AM

### Tool Actions vs Traditional Scripts

| Aspect             | Tool Actions                         | Traditional Scripts                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Setup Time**     | Minutes - just configure credentials | Hours - research APIs, write code        |
| **Maintenance**    | Automatic - tools handle API changes | Manual - update scripts when APIs change |
| **Error Handling** | Built-in retry logic and validation  | Custom implementation required           |
| **Type Safety**    | Full input/output validation         | Depends on implementation                |
| **Monitoring**     | Automatic logging and metrics        | Manual instrumentation needed            |

### Tool Action Categories

Each tool can provide multiple actions, typically organized into four categories:

1. **Create Actions** üìù
   - Add new records, send messages, create items
   - Examples: Slack "Send Message", Trello "Create Card", Google Sheets "Add Row"

2. **Update Actions** ‚úèÔ∏è
   - Modify existing records or states
   - Examples: Jira "Update Issue", Notion "Edit Page", Discord "Change Member Role"

3. **Search Actions** üîç
   - Find and retrieve data
   - Examples: Gmail "Search Messages", Database "Query Records", Slack "Find User"

4. **Delete Actions** üóëÔ∏è
   - Remove records or clean up data
   - Examples: Google Drive "Delete File", Calendar "Remove Event", Trello "Archive Card"
