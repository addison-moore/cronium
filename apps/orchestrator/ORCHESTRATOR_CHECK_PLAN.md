# Orchestrator Error Check and Fix Plan

## 1. Compilation Check

- [x] Check for Go compilation errors - No errors found
- [x] Check for missing imports - None found
- [x] Check for type mismatches - Fixed test function signatures
- [x] Verify all modules build correctly - All building successfully

## 2. Code Quality Issues

- [x] Check for unused variables - None found
- [x] Check for unreachable code - None found
- [ ] Check for potential nil pointer dereferences
- [ ] Check for proper error handling

## 3. Runtime Issues

- [ ] Check container executor functionality
- [ ] Check SSH executor functionality
- [ ] Check multi-server executor functionality
- [ ] Check API client connections
- [ ] Check database connections
- [ ] Check payload service

## 4. Integration Points

- [ ] Verify API endpoints are accessible
- [ ] Check JWT token generation/validation
- [ ] Verify execution creation/updates work
- [ ] Check WebSocket broadcasting
- [ ] Verify job claiming and processing

## 5. Recent Changes Review

- [ ] Multi-server execution ID fix
- [ ] Execution record deduplication
- [ ] Payload path vs inline script content
- [ ] Error handling improvements

## Issues Found

1. **Test compilation errors** - NewExecutor and NewMultiServerExecutor signatures were outdated in tests
2. **Missing nil check** - container/executor.go line 929 was missing apiClient nil check

## Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed test signatures** - Added nil for apiClient parameter in executor_test.go (5 occurrences)
2. **Added nil check** - Added proper nil check for apiClient in container/executor.go:929
3. **Verified all apiClient usages** - Confirmed all other usages have proper nil checks
